## Introduction

**GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** is a powerful document rendering API that allows developers to seamlessly render documents in various formats such as PDF, Microsoft Office, and many more. One of its key functionalities is the ability to extract text coordinates for precise image rendering.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Document Files:** Have sample document files ready for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces

Before diving into the coding process, let's import the necessary namespaces to access the functionalities of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Results;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Viewer and Get View Info

Begin by initializing the `Viewer` object with the document file you intend to process. Then, retrieve the view information of the document, including text coordinates for image rendering.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.pdf"))
{
    ViewInfoOptions options = ViewInfoOptions.ForPngView(true);
    ViewInfo viewInfo = viewer.GetViewInfo(options);
    
    // The rest of the code will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.pdf"` with the path to your document.

## Step 2: Iterate Through Pages, Lines, and Words

Iterate through each page of the document to access text lines, words, and characters.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
foreach (Page page in viewInfo.Pages)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Page: {page.Number}");
    Console.WriteLine("Text lines/words/characters:");
    
    foreach (Line line in page.Lines)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(line);
        
        foreach (Word word in line.Words)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\t" + word);
            
            foreach (Character character in word.Characters)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("\t\t" + character);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
