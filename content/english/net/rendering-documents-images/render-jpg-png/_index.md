# Render Document to JPGPNG

## Introduction

In the world of .NET development, handling documents efficiently is essential for various applications. Whether you're building a document management system, an e-commerce platform, or a content-rich application, the ability to view documents seamlessly is crucial. This is where GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET comes into play, offering a comprehensive solution for rendering documents to various formats such as JPG and PNG.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET, there are a few prerequisites you need to ensure:

1. .NET Development Environment: Ensure that you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine. This includes having the .NET SDK installed.

2. GroupDocs.Viewer License: Obtain a valid license for GroupDocs.Viewer. You can either purchase a license or use a temporary one for evaluation purposes.

3. Installation: Download and install GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET from the provided [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).

4. Document Files: Have the document files ready that you want to render. GroupDocs.Viewer supports various formats including DOCX, PDF, PPT, and more.

## Import Namespaces

To get started with rendering documents using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This allows you to access the functionalities provided by the library.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

Rendering a document to JPG or PNG format is a straightforward process with GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

## Step 1: Define Output Directory

First, define the directory where you want the rendered pages to be saved. This directory should exist and be accessible by the application.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format

Specify the format for the file paths of each rendered page. GroupDocs.Viewer will replace `{0}` with the page number while saving the files.

```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.jpg");
```

## Step 3: Instantiate Viewer Object

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class by providing the path to the document file you want to render.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("Path_to_Your_Document"))
{
    // Code for rendering goes here
}
```

## Step 4: Define Rendering Options

Specify the rendering options according to your requirements. For JPG/PNG rendering, you'll use `JpgViewOptions` or `PngViewOptions`.

```csharp
JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
```

## Step 5: Render Document

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object and pass the rendering options created earlier.

```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 6: Output Results

Once the rendering process is complete, you can inform the user about the successful rendering and provide the directory where the rendered pages are saved.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET offers a powerful solution for rendering documents to various formats, including JPG and PNG. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate document rendering functionality into your .NET applications, enhancing user experience and productivity.
