## Import Namespaces
To utilize GroupDocs.Viewer functionalities in your .NET application, import the required namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where you want to store the rendered document pages.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.png");
```
This line specifies the format for naming the rendered pages. In this example, it uses a placeholder `{0}` to represent the page number.
## Step 3: Initialize Viewer Object
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_DOCX))
{
    // Code block
}
```
Create a `Viewer` object by passing the path of the document to be viewed. In this case, `TestFiles.SAMPLE_DOCX` represents the path of the sample document.
## Step 4: Set Rendering Options
```csharp
PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
options.ExtractText = true;
```
Configure rendering options based on your requirements. Here, `PngViewOptions` is used for rendering pages as PNG images, and `ExtractText` is set to `true` to extract text from the document.
## Step 5: Render Document
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object, passing the rendering options to start the rendering process.
## Step 6: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
After rendering, display a success message indicating the completion of the process and the location where the rendered pages are stored.
