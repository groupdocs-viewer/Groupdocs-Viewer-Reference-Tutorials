## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, managing and displaying various document formats seamlessly is crucial for many applications. **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** emerges as a powerful solution to effortlessly render documents within your .NET applications. Whether it is PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, or PowerPoint presentations, GroupDocs.Viewer simplifies the process, offering an array of features for enhanced document viewing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Sample Document:** A document file (e.g., DOCX) for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces

To utilize GroupDocs.Viewer functionalities in your .NET application, import the required namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and Page File Path Format

First, define the directory where you want to store the rendered document pages and the format for naming the rendered pages.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.png");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure PNG View Options

Create a `Viewer` object by passing the path of the document to be viewed. Then, configure the `PngViewOptions` for rendering pages as PNG images and enable text extraction.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.docx"))
{
    PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.ExtractText = true;
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.docx"` with the path to your document. Setting `ExtractText` to `true` will create a text overlay on the rendered image, making the text selectable.

## Step 3: Render the Document

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object, passing the rendering options to start the rendering process.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display Success Message

After rendering, display a success message indicating the completion of the process and the location where the rendered pages are stored.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

## Conclusion

Incorporating GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET into your projects opens up a world of possibilities for efficient document rendering. With its intuitive API and robust features, handling various document formats becomes seamless, enhancing the user experience.
