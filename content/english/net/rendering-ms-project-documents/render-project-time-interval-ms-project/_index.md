## Introduction

In the realm of software development, efficient handling and rendering of various document formats are paramount. Whether for document viewing or manipulation, having the right tools can significantly enhance productivity and streamline processes. **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** stands out as a versatile solution, offering developers the ability to seamlessly integrate document viewing capabilities into their .NET applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Sample MS Project File:** An MPP file for testing the rendering functionality.

## Import Namespaces

Incorporate the necessary namespaces into your project to access the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Results;
```

Let's break down the example of rendering a specific project time interval from an MS Project file into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

First, specify the directory where the rendered HTML pages will be saved and the format for the file path of each page.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Retrieve View Info

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class with the path to your sample MS Project file. Then, retrieve the project management view information to determine the project's start and end dates.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.mpp"))
{
    ProjectManagementViewInfo viewInfo = viewer.GetViewInfo(
        ViewInfoOptions.ForHtmlView()) as ProjectManagementViewInfo;
    
    // The rest of the code will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.mpp"` with the path to your MS Project file.

## Step 3: Configure HTML View Options and Set Time Interval

Configure the `HtmlViewOptions` for rendering and set the start and end dates for the project interval you want to render.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.ProjectManagementOptions.StartDate = viewInfo.StartDate;
options.ProjectManagementOptions.EndDate = viewInfo.StartDate.AddDays(7);
```
In this example, we are rendering the first week of the project.

## Step 4: Render the Document

Initiate the rendering process with the specified options.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 5: Display Output Directory

Finally, notify the user about the successful rendering and display the directory where the output is saved.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
