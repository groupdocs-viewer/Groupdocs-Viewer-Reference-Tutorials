GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET provides an intuitive way to retrieve view information for Microsoft Project documents. Follow these steps meticulously to achieve this.

## Step 1: Initialize Viewer Object and Retrieve View Info

First, initialize a `Viewer` object with the path to your Microsoft Project document. Then, use the `GetViewInfo()` method to retrieve the view information.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.mpp"))
{
    ProjectManagementViewInfo info = viewer.GetViewInfo(
        ViewInfoOptions.ForHtmlView()) as ProjectManagementViewInfo;
    
    // The rest of the code will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.mpp"` with the path to your MS Project file. We specify `ViewInfoOptions.ForHtmlView()` to obtain view information relevant to an HTML view.

## Step 2: Display the View Information

This step involves displaying the retrieved view information, including the document type, page count, and project start and end dates.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
Console.WriteLine("Document type is: " + info.FileType);
Console.WriteLine("Pages count: " + info.Pages.Count);
Console.WriteLine("Project start date: {0}", info.StartDate);
Console.WriteLine("Project end date: {0}", info.EndDate);
```

## Step 3: Conclude the Process

Finally, we conclude the process by displaying a success message indicating that the view information has been retrieved successfully.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nView info retrieved successfully.");
```
