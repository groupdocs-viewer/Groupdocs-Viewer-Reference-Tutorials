# How to Rename Email Fields During Rendering with GroupDocs.Viewer

## Introduction

Ever opened an email document in your .NET application only to find confusing field labels like "From" when you'd prefer "Sender"? You're not alone. When building professional applications that handle email documents, customizing how email fields appear to your users can make a huge difference in user experience.

GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET solves this challenge elegantly by allowing you to rename email fields during the rendering process. Instead of being stuck with default labels, you can customize field names to match your application's terminology or your users' preferences. This guide walks you through the entire process, from setup to implementation, with practical examples you can use right away.

## Why This Matters for Your Application

Before diving into the code, let's talk about why you might want to rename email fields during rendering. In many business scenarios, standard email field names don't align with company terminology or user expectations.

For example, your HR system might use "Applicant" instead of "From" when displaying job application emails. Or your customer service platform might prefer "Customer" over "Sender" for support tickets. These small changes can significantly improve user comprehension and reduce confusion.

## Common Use Cases

You'll find email field renaming particularly useful in these scenarios:

- **Customer Support Systems**: Rename "From" to "Customer" and "To" to "Support Agent"
- **HR Applications**: Change "From" to "Applicant" and "Subject" to "Position Applied For"
- **Legal Document Management**: Use "Plaintiff" and "Defendant" instead of generic sender/receiver terms
- **Multi-language Applications**: Translate field names to match your application's localization
- **Brand Consistency**: Align field names with your company's internal terminology

## Prerequisites

Before you start renaming email fields, make sure you have these essentials in place:

1. **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET Library**: Download and install it from [the official releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/). The library works with both .NET Framework and .NET Core projects.

2. **Development Environment**: You'll need Visual Studio or another .NET-compatible IDE. The examples work with Visual Studio 2019 or later.

3. **Basic C# Knowledge**: You should be comfortable with C# syntax and object-oriented programming concepts. Don't worry though - the code is straightforward.

4. **Sample Email Documents**: Prepare some test email files (.msg, .eml formats work well) in a directory where your application can access them.

## Import Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# file. These give you access to all the GroupDocs.Viewer functionality you'll need:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

The `GroupDocs.Viewer.Options` namespace is particularly important here - it contains the classes you'll use to configure email field mappings.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

Now let's walk through the complete process of renaming email fields during rendering. I'll break this down into manageable steps that you can follow along with.

### Step 1: Define Output Directory

First, specify where you want the rendered HTML pages to be saved. This is where your customized email documents will end up:

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```

**Pro tip**: Use a dedicated output folder for each rendering job to avoid file conflicts, especially if you're processing multiple documents simultaneously.

### Step 2: Define Page File Path Format

Set up the naming pattern for your rendered HTML files. Each page of the email will be saved as a separate HTML file:

```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```

This format creates files like `page_1.html`, `page_2.html`, etc. You can customize this pattern to match your application's naming conventions.

### Step 3: Initialize Viewer Object

Create the Viewer instance that will handle the rendering process. This is where you specify which email document to process:

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_MSG))
{
```

The `using` statement ensures proper resource disposal after rendering completes. Replace `TestFiles.SAMPLE_MSG` with the actual path to your email file.

### Step 4: Configure HTML View Options

Here's where the magic happens - configuring the email field mappings. This step lets you define exactly how each email field should appear:

```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.EmailOptions.FieldTextMap[Field.From] = "Sender";
options.EmailOptions.FieldTextMap[Field.To] = "Receiver";
options.EmailOptions.FieldTextMap[Field.Sent] = "Date";
options.EmailOptions.FieldTextMap[Field.Subject] = "Topic";
```

Notice how we're mapping standard email fields to more user-friendly names. You can customize these labels to match your specific needs. The `ForEmbeddedResources` method ensures all CSS and images are embedded directly in the HTML output.

### Step 5: Render Document

Execute the rendering process with your custom configuration:

```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```

This single line triggers the entire rendering process, applying your field name customizations to generate the final HTML output.

### Step 6: Display Success Message

Finally, let users know the process completed successfully:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

This feedback is especially helpful during development and debugging.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with straightforward code, you might encounter some challenges. Here are the most common issues and their solutions:

### Issue: Fields Not Renaming
**Symptoms**: Your custom field names aren't appearing in the rendered output.
**Solution**: Double-check that you're setting the field mappings before calling `viewer.View()`. Also verify that the email document actually contains the fields you're trying to rename.

### Issue: Output Files Not Found
**Symptoms**: The success message appears, but you can't find the HTML files.
**Solution**: Check that your output directory path is correct and that your application has write permissions to that location.

### Issue: Rendering Performance Problems
**Symptoms**: Large email files take too long to process.
**Solution**: Consider using `HtmlViewOptions.ForExternalResources()` instead of embedded resources for better performance with large documents.

### Issue: Special Characters in Field Names
**Symptoms**: Custom field names with special characters don't display correctly.
**Solution**: Stick to alphanumeric characters and spaces for field names. If you need special characters, test thoroughly across different browsers.

## Performance Tips and Best Practices

To get the best results when renaming email fields, keep these recommendations in mind:

**Choose Meaningful Names**: Your custom field names should be immediately clear to users. Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood in your domain.

**Keep Names Concise**: While descriptive names are good, overly long field names can break your UI layout. Aim for 1-3 words maximum.

**Test with Real Data**: Always test your field mappings with actual email documents from your production environment. Sample files might not contain all the field variations you'll encounter.

**Cache Rendered Output**: If you're processing the same email documents repeatedly, consider caching the rendered HTML to improve performance.

**Handle Missing Fields Gracefully**: Not all email documents contain every field type. Your application should handle cases where expected fields are missing.

## Advanced Customization Options

Once you're comfortable with basic field renaming, you can explore more advanced customization options:

- **Conditional Field Mapping**: Apply different field names based on email content or metadata
- **Dynamic Language Support**: Change field names based on user locale settings
- **Custom CSS Styling**: Apply specific styling to renamed fields for better visual distinction
- **Field Ordering**: Control the order in which renamed fields appear in the rendered output

## When to Use Email Field Renaming

Email field renaming works best in these situations:

- **User-Facing Applications**: When end users need to understand email content without technical knowledge
- **Specialized Domains**: Industries with specific terminology (legal, medical, financial)
- **Multi-Tenant Applications**: When different clients need different field terminology
- **Localization Requirements**: Applications serving users in multiple languages

However, avoid field renaming if you're building developer tools or APIs where standard field names are expected.
