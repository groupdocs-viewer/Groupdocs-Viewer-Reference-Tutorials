## Implementation Guide

Now, let's explore how you can implement various document conversion features using GroupDocs.Viewer .NET.

### Render PST/OST Document to HTML

#### Overview
Converting PST/OST files to HTML allows for easy sharing and viewing of email archives in web browsers. This feature is perfect for creating web-based presentations or reports from your Outlook data.

**Step 1: Set Up Output Directory**
```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "RenderToHTML");
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "PST_result.html");

// Ensure the output directory exists.
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
```

**Step 2: Configure HTML View Options**

Configure options to embed resources directly into the HTML for better portability:

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\SAMPLE_PST"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);

    // Render the document to HTML format using specified options.
    viewer.View(options);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources`: Embeds all resources (like images) into the HTML, making it self-contained.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths are correctly specified and accessible.
- Check file permissions in your output directory if encountering access issues.

### Render PST/OST Document to JPG

#### Overview
Creating JPG images from PST/OST files is useful for generating previews or thumbnails of email archives.

**Step 1: Set Up Output Directory**
```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "RenderToJPG");
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "PST_result_{0}.jpg");

// Ensure the output directory exists.
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
```

**Step 2: Configure JPG View Options**

Use a placeholder for dynamic file naming:

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\SAMPLE_PST"))
{
    JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);

    // Render the document to JPG format using specified options.
    viewer.View(options);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `JpgViewOptions`: Allows you to specify output paths dynamically with placeholders.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Verify that your system supports image generation and has sufficient memory for processing large files.

### Render PST/OST Document to PNG

#### Overview
PNG format is ideal for high-quality, lossless images of email content. This feature allows detailed snapshots of your Outlook archives.

**Step 1: Set Up Output Directory**
```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "RenderToPNG");
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "PST_result_{0}.png");

// Ensure the output directory exists.
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
```

**Step 2: Configure PNG View Options**

Configure options with placeholders for file names:

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\SAMPLE_PST"))
{
    PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);

    // Render the document to PNG format using specified options.
    viewer.View(options);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `PngViewOptions`: Similar to JPG, but optimized for lossless image output.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- For large PST/OST files, monitor memory usage during rendering.

### Render PST/OST Document to PDF

#### Overview
Converting PST/OST files into a single PDF document is useful for archiving or sharing email data in a universally accessible format.

**Step 1: Set Up Output Directory**
```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "RenderToPDF");
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "PST_result.pdf");

// Ensure the output directory exists.
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
```

**Step 2: Configure PDF View Options**

Configure options for a single document output:

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\SAMPLE_PST"))
{
    PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);

    // Render the document to PDF format using specified options.
    viewer.View(options);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `PdfViewOptions`: Used for rendering documents into a consolidated PDF file.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Check if your document includes unsupported elements that might affect PDF conversion.
