        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Rendering Archive Files with Specified Filenames

#### Overview
This feature allows you to render archive files into PDF format while specifying the output filename.

##### Step 1: Set Up Viewer and Options
Begin by setting up the `Viewer` object and configuring the PDF rendering options:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string outputDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
        
        using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("path/to/your/archive.zip"))
        {
            PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "custom-filename.pdf"));

            // Render the archive to PDF with specified filename
            viewer.View(options);
        }
    }
}
```

##### Step 2: Explanation of Parameters and Configuration
- **Viewer**: Initializes with the path to your archive file.
- **PdfViewOptions**: Accepts a string parameter for specifying the output PDF's filename.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the output directory exists before running the code.
- Verify that you have write permissions for the specified path.

## Practical Applications

### Use Cases and Integration Possibilities
1. **Automated Report Generation**: Convert archived reports into PDFs with predefined filenames to maintain consistency in documentation.
2. **Invoice Archiving**: Automatically generate PDF invoices from ZIP files, specifying a filename based on invoice details.
3. **Email Attachments**: Use this feature when integrating email clients that download attachments as archives.

### Integration Possibilities
- Integrate with .NET web applications for dynamic document rendering.
- Combine with cloud storage APIs to fetch and render archived documents directly in the cloud.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Performance
- **Resource Management**: Ensure proper disposal of `Viewer` objects using `using` statements to prevent memory leaks.
- **Batch Processing**: Process large batches of files asynchronously to optimize resource usage.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management with GroupDocs.Viewer
- Always release resources by disposing of the viewer object after operations.
- Avoid loading large files into memory at once; use streaming where possible.
