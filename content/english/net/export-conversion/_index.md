Even simple text files can benefit from enhanced presentation through conversion. This guide shows you how to transform plain text into formatted documents with proper styling and layout options.

## Best Practices for Document Export and Conversion

**Memory Management**: When processing large documents or handling batch conversions, always implement proper disposal patterns. Use `using` statements with GroupDocs.Viewer objects to prevent memory leaks.

**Configuration Optimization**: Different document types benefit from specific rendering options. For example, when converting CAD files, you might want to adjust DPI settings, while office documents may need font substitution rules.

**Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive exception handling that accounts for corrupted files, unsupported format versions, and network issues (when loading from remote sources). Your users will appreciate meaningful error messages instead of generic failures.

**Performance Monitoring**: For production environments, monitor conversion times and resource usage. Consider implementing async processing for large files and provide progress indicators for better user experience.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Font Rendering Problems**: If converted documents don't match the original formatting, check font availability on your server. GroupDocs.Viewer can use font substitution, but having the original fonts installed provides better results.

**Large File Processing**: When dealing with documents over 50MB, consider implementing streaming or chunked processing to avoid timeout issues. You can also pre-process files to optimize them before conversion.

**Format-Specific Quirks**: Some formats have unique requirements. For instance, email files (PST/OST) may need specific encoding settings, while CAD files might require dimension adjustments for proper scaling.

**Output Quality Issues**: If your converted images appear blurry or pixelated, experiment with DPI settings and output format options. Higher DPI settings produce better quality but larger file sizes.

## When to Use Each Output Format

**HTML Conversion**: Choose HTML when you need searchable, interactive content that works in web browsers. This format preserves text selectability and hyperlinks but may not maintain pixel-perfect layout.

**PDF Export**: Use PDF for documents that need to maintain exact formatting across different devices and platforms. Perfect for legal documents, contracts, and official reports.

**PNG/JPG Images**: Convert to images when you need visual previews or thumbnails. PNG preserves transparency and provides lossless compression, while JPG offers smaller file sizes for photographs and complex graphics.
