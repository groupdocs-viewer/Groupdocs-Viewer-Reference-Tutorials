To start rendering responsive HTML, import the necessary namespaces into your project:

Let's break down the rendering process into multiple steps:

```
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
Specify the format for naming the HTML files for each page:
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
## Step 3: Initialize Viewer Object
Create an instance of the Viewer class and specify the document to be rendered:
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_DOCX))
{
    // Rendering code will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Configure HTML View Options
Set up the HTML view options, including enabling responsive rendering:
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.RenderResponsive = true;
```
## Step 5: Render Document into HTML
Use the View method of the Viewer object to render the document into HTML:
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
## Step 6: Output Success Message
Display a message indicating that the document has been successfully rendered:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
