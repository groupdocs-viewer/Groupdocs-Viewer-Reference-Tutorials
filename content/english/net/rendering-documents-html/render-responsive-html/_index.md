This tutorial will guide you through the process of rendering responsive HTML using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to seamlessly convert documents into HTML that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across all devices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).

*   **Document Files:** Prepare the document files that you want to render into responsive HTML.

## Import Namespaces

To start rendering responsive HTML, import the necessary namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

Let's break down the rendering process into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and Page File Path Format

First, define the directory where you want the rendered HTML pages to be saved and specify the format for naming the HTML files for each page.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class and specify the document to be rendered. Then, set up the `HtmlViewOptions`, including enabling responsive rendering.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.docx"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.RenderResponsive = true;
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.docx"` with the path to your document.

## Step 3: Render the Document into HTML

Use the `View` method of the `Viewer` object to render the document into HTML.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display the Output Success Message

Finally, display a message indicating that the document has been successfully rendered.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
