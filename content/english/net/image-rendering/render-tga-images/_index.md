## Introduction
In today's digital landscape, the ability to seamlessly render various image formats is essential for many applications. One such format is TGA (Truevision Graphics Adapter), known for its high-quality images and widespread use in graphics-intensive industries. If you're a .NET developer looking to incorporate TGA image rendering into your applications, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to leverage GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET to render TGA images effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET Library: You'll need to download and install the GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library. You can obtain the library from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
2. Development Environment: Ensure you have a working development environment set up for .NET development, including Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial for understanding the code examples provided in this tutorial.

## Import Namespaces
Before we begin rendering TGA images, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
using System;
using System.IO;
```
Now, let's break down the process of rendering TGA images into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Define Output Directory
First, specify the directory where you want the rendered files to be saved:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Render TGA Images to HTML
To render TGA images to HTML format, use the following code:
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "tga_result.html");
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_TGA))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.View(options);
}
```
This code initializes the Viewer object with the TGA image file and specifies HTML as the output format.
## Step 3: Render TGA Images to JPG
To render TGA images to JPG format, use the following code:
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "tga_result.jpg");
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_TGA))
{
    JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.View(options);
}
```
Similarly, you can render TGA images to other formats such as PNG and PDF by adjusting the output format accordingly.
