# Load Password-Protected Documents

## Introduction
In today's digital age, managing and viewing various document formats seamlessly is a necessity for many businesses and individuals alike. Luckily, GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET provides a comprehensive solution for .NET developers to effortlessly integrate document viewing capabilities into their applications. In this tutorial, we'll delve into one of the essential functionalities of GroupDocs.Viewer: loading password-protected documents. We'll break down the process step by step, ensuring that developers can easily follow along and implement this feature into their projects.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET
Make sure you have GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
### 2. Obtain a Password-Protected Document
For testing purposes, have a password-protected document available. This will allow us to demonstrate the loading process effectively.

## Import Namespaces
Before we proceed with the tutorial, let's import the necessary namespaces to our project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory
First, specify the directory where you want the rendered output to be saved:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path of your desired directory.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
Next, define the format for the file path of each rendered page:
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
This format will generate file paths like `"Your Document Directory/page_1.html"`, `"Your Document Directory/page_2.html"`, and so on.
## Step 3: Configure Load Options
Configure the load options for the password-protected document, including the password:
```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions
{
    Password = "12345"
};
```
Replace `"12345"` with the actual password of your document.
## Step 4: Initialize Viewer
Initialize the GroupDocs.Viewer with the document and load options:
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("Path_to_your_document", loadOptions))
{
    // Code for viewing options will be added in the next step.
}
```
Replace `"Path_to_your_document"` with the path to your password-protected document.
## Step 5: Configure HTML View Options
Configure HTML view options for rendering the document with embedded resources:
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```
## Step 6: Render Document
Render the document using the configured viewer and view options:
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
## Step 7: Display Success Message
Inform the user that the document has been rendered successfully:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
