## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on using **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** to render grid lines in your spreadsheets. Whether you are a seasoned developer or new to the .NET framework, this tutorial will walk you through the process with detailed explanations and easy-to-follow examples.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Sample Spreadsheet:** An XLSX file for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, start by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Output Directory and File Path Format

First, specify the directory where the rendered HTML pages will be saved and create a format for the page file paths.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Instantiate the `Viewer` class with the path to your spreadsheet. Then, configure the `HtmlViewOptions` to enable the rendering of grid lines.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.XLSX"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderGridLines = true;
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.XLSX"` with the path to your spreadsheet.

## Step 3: Render the Document with Grid Lines

Invoke the `View` method to render the document with the specified options. In this example, we are rendering the first three pages.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options, 1, 2, 3);
```
You can adjust the page numbers according to your requirements.

That's it! You have successfully rendered a spreadsheet with grid lines using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.
