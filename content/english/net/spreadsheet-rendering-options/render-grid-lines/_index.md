## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
- GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: Download and install the library from the [official website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
- Your Document Directory: Make sure you have a designated directory for your documents, and replace "Your Document Directory" in the provided code snippet with the actual path.
Now that you have everything set up, let's get started.
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, start by importing the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```
## Step 1: Set up the Document Directory
Begin by specifying the path to your documents directory:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path where your documents are stored.
## Step 2: Define File Path and HTML Output Format
Create a variable to store the file path format for each page and the output HTML format:
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
This line constructs the file path for each page in the specified format.
## Step 3: Initialize GroupDocs.Viewer
Instantiate the Viewer class with the document you want to view:
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(outputDirectory + "SAMPLE.XLSX"))
{
    // Further steps will be performed within this using block.
}
```
Ensure to replace "SAMPLE.XLSX" with the name of your actual document.
## Step 4: Configure HTML View Options
Set up the HTML view options, specifically enabling the rendering of grid lines:
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderGridLines = true;
```
This code snippet configures the HTML view options to embed resources and render grid lines for spreadsheet documents.
## Step 5: Render Grid Lines
Invoke the `View` method to render the document with the specified options for pages 1, 2, and 3:
```csharp
viewer.View(options, 1, 2, 3);
```
Adjust the page numbers according to your requirements.
That's it! You have successfully rendered grid lines using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.
