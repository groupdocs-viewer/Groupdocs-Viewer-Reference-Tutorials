## Introduction
Welcome to the fascinating world of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET! If you're a developer or enthusiast keen on exploring powerful document viewing capabilities within your .NET applications, you're in for a treat. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the intricacies of retrieving worksheet names using GroupDocs.Viewer. So, fasten your seatbelt and let's embark on this exciting journey!
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the coding magic, let's ensure you have everything set up:
1. Install GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: Head over to the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/) to grab the latest version of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. Follow the installation instructions to integrate it seamlessly into your development environment.
2. Get Your Document Ready: Ensure you have a target document, let's say an Excel file named "file.xlsx," in your designated document directory.
## Import Namespaces
Now that you have the prerequisites in place, let's kick things off by importing the necessary namespaces. This ensures your application recognizes and can utilize the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Results;
```
## 1. Setting up the Document Directory
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace "Your Document Directory" with the path to the directory where your target document is located.
## 2. Initializing the Viewer
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "file.xlsx")))
```
In this step, we create an instance of the Viewer class, providing the path to your Excel file.
## 3. Configuring View Information Options
```csharp
ViewInfoOptions viewInfoOptions = ViewInfoOptions.ForHtmlView();
viewInfoOptions.SpreadsheetOptions = SpreadsheetOptions.ForOnePagePerSheet();
```
Here, we configure the ViewInfoOptions to generate HTML views and set additional options for spreadsheet rendering.
## 4. Retrieving View Information
```csharp
ViewInfo viewInfo = viewer.GetViewInfo(viewInfoOptions);
```
Utilize the Viewer instance to retrieve view information based on the configured options.
## 5. Displaying Worksheet Names
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Worksheets:");
foreach (Page page in viewInfo.Pages)
{
    Console.WriteLine($" - Worksheet {page.Number} name '{page.Name}'");
}
```
Loop through the retrieved pages and print the name of each worksheet to the console.
