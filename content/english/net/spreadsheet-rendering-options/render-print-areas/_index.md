HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.SpreadsheetOptions = SpreadsheetOptions.ForRenderingPrintArea();
```
## Step 5: Render the Document
Invoke the `View` method to render the document with the specified options:
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
