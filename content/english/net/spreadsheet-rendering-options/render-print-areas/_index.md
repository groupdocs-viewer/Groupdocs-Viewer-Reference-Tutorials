## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on using **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** to render only the print areas of your spreadsheets. If you are a .NET developer looking for a robust solution for document rendering, you are in the right place. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of rendering print areas to HTML, ensuring a seamless experience in your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Sample Document:** A spreadsheet file (e.g., `SAMPLE.XLSX`) with defined print areas.

## Import Namespaces

Make sure to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code for proper implementation:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Output Directory and File Path Format

First, specify the directory where the rendered HTML pages will be saved and create a format for the page file paths.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Instantiate the `Viewer` class with the path to your sample document. Then, configure the `HtmlViewOptions` to render only the print areas of the spreadsheet.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.XLSX"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.SpreadsheetOptions = SpreadsheetOptions.ForRenderingPrintArea();
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.XLSX"` with the path to your spreadsheet.

## Step 3: Render the Document

Invoke the `View` method to render the document with the specified options.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display Success Message

Finally, print a success message indicating that the source document has been rendered successfully.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to use GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET to render only the print areas of your spreadsheets. This powerful tool opens up new possibilities for document rendering in your .NET applications.
