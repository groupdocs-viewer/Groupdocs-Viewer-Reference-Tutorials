## Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial on rendering documents by page breaks using **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET**. In this guide, we will explore how to leverage the powerful features of GroupDocs.Viewer to render spreadsheets with precision, specifically focusing on page breaks. Whether you are an experienced developer or just starting, this tutorial will walk you through the process step-by-step.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Source Document:** A spreadsheet file with page breaks (e.g., `PAGE_BREAKS.XLSX`).

## Import Namespaces

To get started, import the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. This will give you access to the classes and methods required for rendering by page breaks.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Set Output Directory and File Path

First, define the directory where the rendered document will be saved and the full path for the output file.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "output.pdf");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure PDF View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class with the path to your source document. Then, set up `PdfViewOptions` and specify that the spreadsheet should be rendered by page breaks.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("PAGE_BREAKS.XLSX"))
{
    PdfViewOptions viewOptions = new PdfViewOptions(outputFilePath);
    viewOptions.SpreadsheetOptions = SpreadsheetOptions.ForRenderingByPageBreaks();
    
    // Further configuration will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"PAGE_BREAKS.XLSX"` with the path to your spreadsheet.

## Step 3: Enable Rendering of Grid Lines and Headings

For better visualization, you can enable the rendering of grid lines and headings in the output PDF.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewOptions.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderGridLines = true;
viewOptions.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderHeadings = true;
```

## Step 4: Perform Document Rendering

Execute the rendering process using the configured options.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(viewOptions);
```

## Step 5: Display Success Message

Finally, notify the user that the source document has been rendered successfully.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to render a spreadsheet by its page breaks using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. This powerful feature gives you precise control over how your documents are displayed. Experiment with different options to customize the rendering according to your specific requirements.
