## Introduction

In the dynamic world of .NET development, managing text overflow in spreadsheet cells is crucial for creating visually appealing and readable documents. **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** empowers developers with a comprehensive set of tools to seamlessly handle text overflow. This tutorial will guide you through the process of adjusting text overflow in cells using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A basic understanding of .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Sample Document:** A spreadsheet with text overflow for practice.

## Import Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces into your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Output Directory and File Path Format

First, define the directory where the rendered HTML file will be saved and the format for the output file path.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class and load the document that contains text overflow. Then, specify the `HtmlViewOptions` and set the `TextOverflowMode` to control how text overflow is handled.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_SAMPLE_FILE.xlsx"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.SpreadsheetOptions.TextOverflowMode = TextOverflowMode.HideText;
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"YOUR_SAMPLE_FILE.xlsx"` with the path to your spreadsheet. The `TextOverflowMode.HideText` option will hide any text that overflows the cell boundaries.

## Step 3: Execute the Viewer and Display the Results

Invoke the `View` method with the specified options to generate the output. Finally, notify the user about the successful rendering and provide the path to the output directory.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);

Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

Now you have successfully adjusted text overflow in cells using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. Experiment with different settings and integrate this functionality seamlessly into your .NET applications.

In conclusion, GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET simplifies the task of handling text overflow in cells, ensuring that your documents are not only functional but also visually polished. With these steps, you can enhance the user experience and readability of your spreadsheet documents effortlessly.
