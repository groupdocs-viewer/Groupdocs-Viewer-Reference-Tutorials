## Import Namespaces

In your C# code, make sure to import the necessary namespaces to use GroupDocs.Viewer:

```

## Step 1: Set Up the Output Directory

First, define the directory where the rendered files will be saved.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Render to HTML

To render the spreadsheet to HTML with row and column headings, use the following code.

```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.XLSX"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderHeadings = true;
    
    // Render the first three pages
    viewer.View(options, 1, 2, 3);
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.XLSX"` with the path to your spreadsheet.

## Step 3: Render to JPG

To render the spreadsheet to JPG images with headings, use this code.

```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.jpg");

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.XLSX"))
{
    JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderHeadings = true;
    
    viewer.View(options, 1, 2, 3);
}
```

## Step 4: Render to PNG

To render the spreadsheet to PNG images with headings, use the following code.

```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.png");

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.XLSX"))
{
    PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderHeadings = true;
    
    viewer.View(options, 1, 2, 3);
}
```

## Step 5: Render to PDF

To render the spreadsheet to a PDF document with headings, use this code.

```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "output.pdf");

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.XLSX"))
{
    PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(outputFilePath);
    options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderHeadings = true;
    
    viewer.View(options, 1, 2, 3);
