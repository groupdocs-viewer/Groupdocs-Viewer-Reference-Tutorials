## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** to protect a rendered PDF with a password. By adding security measures, you can control access to your PDF documents, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Sample Document:** A document file (e.g., DOCX) to be rendered to a protected PDF.

## Import Namespaces

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path

First, define the directory where the protected PDF will be saved and the full path for the output file.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "output_protected.pdf");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Configure Security Options

Set up the `Security` options to define the passwords and permissions for the PDF.

```csharp
Security security = new Security
{
    DocumentOpenPassword = "open_password",
    PermissionsPassword = "permissions_password",
    Permissions = Permissions.AllowAll ^ Permissions.DenyPrinting
};
```
**Explanation:**
*   `DocumentOpenPassword`: Sets the password required to open the PDF.
*   `PermissionsPassword`: Sets the password required to change the permissions.
*   `Permissions`: Defines the allowed actions. In this case, we allow all permissions except for printing by using a bitwise XOR operation.

## Step 3: Initialize Viewer and Configure PDF View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class with the path to your document. Then, configure the `PdfViewOptions` with the security settings.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.docx"))
{
    PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(outputFilePath)
    {
        Security = security
    };
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.docx"` with the path to your document.

## Step 4: Render the Document with Security Options

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object, passing the configured `PdfViewOptions`.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 5: Display Success Message

Finally, inform the user that the document has been rendered successfully.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

By following these steps, you can protect a rendered PDF with a password using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. This ensures that your documents remain secure and accessible only to authorized users.
