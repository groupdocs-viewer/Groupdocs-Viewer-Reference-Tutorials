## Introduction

**GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** is a powerful tool for rendering various document formats into PDF. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Document Files:** Prepare the document files you want to render. Supported formats include DOCX, PDF, PPTX, XLSX, and more.

## Import Namespaces

Before diving into the code, ensure you import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

Now, let's break down the rendering process into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path

First, specify the directory where you want to save the rendered PDF file and the full path for the output file.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "output.pdf");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure PDF View Options

Instantiate the `Viewer` object with the path to your document file. Then, create an instance of `PdfViewOptions` and specify the output file path.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.docx"))
{
    PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(outputFilePath);
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.docx"` with the path to your document.

## Step 3: Render the Document to PDF

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object, passing the configured `PdfViewOptions`.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display Success Message

Finally, display a message indicating the successful rendering of the document.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

After following these steps, you will have successfully rendered your document to PDF using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.
