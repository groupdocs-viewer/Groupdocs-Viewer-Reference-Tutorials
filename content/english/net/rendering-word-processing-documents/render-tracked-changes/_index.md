## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
Specify the format for the page file paths. This format will determine how the rendered pages are named and stored.
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
Here, `"page_{0}.html"` indicates that the pages will be named as `page_1.html`, `page_2.html`, and so on.

Ensure to replace `TestFiles.SAMPLE_DOCX_WITH_TRACKED_CHANGES` with the path to your document.
## Step 4: Configure HTML View Options

HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.WordProcessingOptions.RenderTrackedChanges = true;
```
This step enables rendering tracked changes in the output HTML.
## Step 5: Render Document
Render the document using the configured options.
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
