## Implementation Guide

Now that we've set up our environment and installed the necessary packages, let's implement the feature to retrieve and display supported file types.

### Feature Overview

This section will guide you through fetching a list of supported file formats from GroupDocs.Viewer and displaying them by their extensions. This functionality can enhance user interaction by clearly showing what files are manageable within your application.

#### Step 1: Define File Type Class

First, define a class to represent the file types:

```csharp
using System;

// Simulated FileType class for demonstration purposes
class DummyFileTypeClass 
{ 
    public string Extension; 
    public override string ToString() => Extension; 
}

type FileType = DummyFileTypeClass;
```

#### Step 2: Retrieve Supported File Types

Next, simulate a method to mimic the retrieval of supported file formats:

```csharp
static IEnumerable<FileType> GetSupportedFileTypes()
{
    return new List<FileType>
    {
        new FileType { Extension = ".pdf\
