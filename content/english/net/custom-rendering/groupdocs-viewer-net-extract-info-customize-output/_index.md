Install GroupDocs.Viewer through NuGet Package Manager or the .NET CLI:

**NuGet Package Manager Console:**
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Viewer -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI:**
```bash

- **Temporary License**: For extended testing, consider acquiring a temporary license from the [GroupDocs website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: For full production use, purchase a subscription.

### Basic Initialization and Setup:
Here's how you can initialize GroupDocs.Viewer in your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Viewer;

namespace DocumentViewerApp
{
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string filePath = @"C:\Path\To\Your\Document.pdf";
        
        using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
        {
            // Your code to interact with the document goes here.
        }
    }
}
```

**Implementation Guide:**
### Feature 1: Getting Basic Information About a Document
#### Overview:
Retrieving essential information about a document is crucial for understanding its structure before performing operations. GroupDocs.Viewer allows you to extract metadata such as page count and file type.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
##### Step 1: Initialize the Viewer with Your Document
Specify the path to your document, replacing `'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY'` with the actual directory where your files are stored:
```csharp
string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SamplePDF.pdf";
```
##### Step 2: Retrieve View Information for HTML Rendering
Create an instance of `ViewInfoOptions` designed specifically for rendering in HTML format to access the document's view information efficiently:
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
{
    ViewInfoOptions options = ViewInfoOptions.ForHtmlView();
    ViewInfo info = viewer.GetViewInfo(options);
    
    // Output basic document information, such as page count.
    Console.WriteLine($"Document type: {info.FileType}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Page count: {info.Pages.Count}");
}
```
**Explanation:** 
- `ForHtmlView()` configures options to retrieve view details suitable for HTML rendering.
- `GetViewInfo(options)` extracts metadata about the document.

##### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure your file path is correctly specified and accessible by the application.
- Verify that the document format is supported by GroupDocs.Viewer if encountering errors with `GetViewInfo`.

### Feature 2: Customizing Output Directory for Document Views
#### Overview:
Custom output directories are essential when rendering documents to different formats. This feature allows you to specify where rendered files should be stored, providing better control over file system organization.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
##### Step 1: Define Input and Output Paths
Set up variables for both input (source document) and output paths:
```csharp
string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SamplePDF.pdf";
string outputPath = @"@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```
##### Step 2: Initialize the Viewer and Configure HTML View Options
Configure `HtmlViewOptions` to specify where rendered HTML files should be saved, using `{page}.html` as a placeholder for dynamic naming:
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(outputPath + "\{page}.html");
    viewer.View(options);
}
```
**Explanation:** 
- `ForEmbeddedResources()` ensures resources such as images are embedded within the HTML, simplifying deployment.
- The specified path in `outputPath` is crucial for organizing your output files effectively.

##### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Check permissions on the output directory to ensure files can be written there.
- Validate the format string used for naming pages (e.g., `{page}.html`) to prevent runtime errors.

**Practical Applications:**
GroupDocs.Viewer offers a variety of real-world applications:
1. **Document Management Systems**: Automatically extract metadata and render documents for web-based access.
2. **Digital Signatures**: Use extracted information to manage signed documents efficiently.

4. **Integrated CRM Platforms**: Enhance customer relationship management by embedding document views directly into customer dashboards.
5. **Educational Portals**: Provide students with easy access to course materials through customized renderings.

**Performance Considerations:**
Optimizing performance when using GroupDocs.Viewer is crucial, especially for large-scale applications:
- **Resource Management**: Always close the `Viewer` instance after use to free up memory resources.
- **Batch Processing**: Process documents in batches if dealing with multiple files simultaneously to reduce load times.
- **Caching Strategies**: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed document views to improve performance.
