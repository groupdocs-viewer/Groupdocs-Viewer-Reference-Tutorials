## Implementation Guide

We'll break down rendering MS Project documents into four formats: HTML, JPG, PNG, and PDF.

### Rendering to HTML with Notes

**Overview:** Convert your MS Project document into an HTML file while including all project notes.

1. **Setup Output Directory**
   Ensure the output directory exists to store the rendered files:
   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "HTML");
   if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
   {
       Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
   }
   ```

2. **Configure HTML View Options**
   Initialize `HtmlViewOptions` to render notes in your document:
   ```csharp
   using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "SampleProject.mpp")))
   {
       HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
       options.RenderNotes = true;
        
       viewer.View(options);
   }
   ```

### Rendering to JPG with Notes

**Overview:** Transform your MS Project file into a series of JPG images, preserving notes.

1. **Setup Output Directory**
   Create the directory for storing JPG outputs:
   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "JPG");
   if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
   {
       Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
   }
   ```

2. **Configure JPG View Options**
   Set up `JpgViewOptions` to include notes in the rendered images:
   ```csharp
   using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "SampleProject.mpp")))
   {
       JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
       options.RenderNotes = true;
        
       viewer.View(options);
   }
   ```

### Rendering to PNG with Notes

**Overview:** Generate PNG images from your MS Project file, retaining notes.

1. **Setup Output Directory**
   Ensure the directory for PNG files exists:
   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "PNG");
   if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
   {
       Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
   }
   ```

2. **Configure PNG View Options**
   Use `PngViewOptions` to render notes in your document as PNG:
   ```csharp
   using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "SampleProject.mpp")))
   {
       PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
       options.RenderNotes = true;
        
       viewer.View(options);
   }
   ```

### Rendering to PDF with Notes

**Overview:** Convert the MS Project document into a PDF file while keeping notes intact.

1. **Setup Output Directory**
   Create the directory for storing the output PDF:
   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "PDF");
   if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
   {
       Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
   }
   ```

2. **Configure PDF View Options**
   Set up `PdfViewOptions` to render notes into the PDF document:
   ```csharp
   using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "SampleProject.mpp")))
   {
       PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
