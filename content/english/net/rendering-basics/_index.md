## Common Implementation Challenges (And How to Solve Them)

**Memory Issues with Large Documents**: Use the `CacheFolderPath` option to enable disk-based caching and prevent memory overflow when processing large files.

**Slow Rendering Performance**: Implement page-specific rendering instead of processing entire documents. Most tutorials above show how to render specific pages or ranges.

**Font Rendering Problems**: When converting to HTML, use the font embedding options covered in our font embedding tutorial to ensure consistent appearance across different systems.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Always test your rendering output on different browsers and devices, especially when using HTML output format.

## Performance Optimization Tips

**Enable Caching**: Set up proper caching strategies to avoid re-rendering the same documents repeatedly.

**Use Asynchronous Operations**: Implement async/await patterns when rendering multiple documents or large files to keep your UI responsive.

**Optimize Output Settings**: Choose appropriate image quality settings for your use case—you don't always need maximum quality for preview purposes.

**Batch Processing**: When converting multiple documents, process them in batches rather than one at a time to optimize resource usage.

## Getting Started: Next Steps

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with our [HTML rendering guide](./implement-net-html-rendering-groupdocs-viewer/) to understand the basics
2. **Choose Your Format**: Review the format-specific tutorials based on your output requirements
3. **Optimize Performance**: Implement caching and async patterns as your application grows
