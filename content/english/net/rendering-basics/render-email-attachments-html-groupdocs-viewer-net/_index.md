## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the implementation process into manageable sections to better understand how to render email attachments to HTML using GroupDocs.Viewer.
### Feature Overview: Render Email Attachments to HTML
This feature allows you to convert various types of email attachments directly into a viewable HTML format. This can be particularly useful for sharing documents in a web-friendly way without requiring additional software or plugins.
#### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path
Set up paths for your input files and output directory:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS";
```
These variables will guide where the attachments are read from and where the HTML files will be saved.
#### Step 2: Extract Attachments
Use GroupDocs.Viewer to fetch all attachments from your email file:
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
{
    var attachments = viewer.GetAttachments();
    foreach (var attachment in attachments)
    {
        // Process each attachment here
    }
}
```
#### Step 3: Render Attachments as HTML
For each attachment, convert it into HTML using the `RenderAttachmentToHTML` method:
```csharp
private static void RenderAttachmentToHTML(Attachment attachment, MemoryStream attachmentStream,
string outputDirectory)
{
    string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
    string extension = Path.GetExtension(attachment.FileName);
    FileType fileType = FileType.FromExtension(extension);

    LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions(fileType);

    using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(attachmentStream, loadOptions))
    {
        HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
        viewer.View(options);
    }
}
```
### Parameters and Configuration
- **`pageFilePathFormat`:** Defines the output HTML file naming convention.
- **`FileType`:** Determines the type of document you are rendering.
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your paths are correctly set up to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Validate that your attachments can be rendered by checking their supported types in GroupDocs documentation.

Following best practices ensures your application runs smoothly without unnecessary strain on system resources.
