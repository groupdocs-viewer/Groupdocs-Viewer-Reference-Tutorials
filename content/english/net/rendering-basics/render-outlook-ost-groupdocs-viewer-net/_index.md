## Implementation Guide

### Rendering Outlook Data Files

Render emails from an Outlook OST file using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:

#### Initialize the Viewer
Start by setting up your environment and initializing the viewer with your specific Outlook data file path.
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_OST_SUBFOLDERS"))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```

#### Configure HTML View Options
Configure `HtmlViewOptions` for embedded resources to include all necessary assets within the generated HTML files.
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```

##### Set Folder to Render
Specify which folder from your Outlook data file you want to render. Here, we target the Inbox folder:
```csharp
options.OutlookOptions.Folder = "Inbox";
```

#### Execute Rendering
Call the `View` method with the configured options to start rendering your Outlook data.
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the OST file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify folder names are accurate; they may need localization adjustments.
- Check for sufficient disk space in the output directory.
