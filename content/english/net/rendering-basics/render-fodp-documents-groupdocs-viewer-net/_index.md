using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_FODP"))
{
    // Initialization code goes here
}
```

### Implementation Guide
Now, let's explore how to render FODP documents into various formats using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

#### Rendering FODP to HTML
Rendering a document as HTML makes it easily viewable on any web-enabled device, perfect for sharing or online viewing scenarios.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. **Set Up the Output Directory and File Path**
   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "Fodp_result.html");
   ```
2. **Initialize Viewer Class**
   ```csharp
   using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_FODP"))
   {
       HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
       viewer.View(options);
   }
   ```
   - *Explanation:* This code initializes the `Viewer` class and sets up HTML view options with embedded resources, rendering your document as an HTML file.

#### Rendering FODP to JPG
Converting documents into images provides high-quality outputs ideal for presentations or documentation purposes.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. **Set Up the Output Directory and File Path**
   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "Fodp_result.jpg");
   ```
2. **Initialize Viewer Class**
   ```csharp
   using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_FODP"))
   {
       JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
       viewer.View(options);
   }
   ```
   - *Explanation:* This snippet sets up the JPG view options, converting each page of your document into a separate JPEG image.

#### Rendering FODP to PNG
PNG format is perfect for high-resolution images with transparency support.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. **Set Up the Output Directory and File Path**
   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "Fodp_result.png");
   ```
2. **Initialize Viewer Class**
   ```csharp
   using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_FODP"))
   {
       PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
       viewer.View(options);
   }
   ```
   - *Explanation:* This code snippet enables conversion of your FODP document into PNG format, preserving high-quality graphics.

#### Rendering FODP to PDF
Creating portable documents that can be easily shared or printed is seamless with PDF.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. **Set Up the Output Directory and File Path**
   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "Fodp_result.pdf");
   ```
2. **Initialize Viewer Class**
   ```csharp
   using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_FODP"))
   {
       PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
       viewer.View(options);
   }
   ```
   - *Explanation:* This snippet sets the PDF view options, converting your document into a portable and widely compatible format.

### Practical Applications
