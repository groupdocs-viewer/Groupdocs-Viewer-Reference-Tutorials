## Implementation Guide

This section explains how to render IGS files into various formats using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

### Rendering IGS to HTML
**Overview**: Convert an IGS file to a web-friendly HTML format with embedded resources.

#### Step 1: Define the Output Directory
Set up a directory where your rendered HTML files will be stored.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "HTML_OUTPUT");
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory); // Ensure the output directory exists
```

#### Step 2: Configure View Options
Specify how you want to render the IGS file into HTML using `HtmlViewOptions`.

```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "IGS_result.html");

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_IGS"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.View(options); // Render the IGS file into HTML format
}
```

### Rendering IGS to JPG
**Overview**: Create high-quality JPEG images from your IGS files.

#### Step 1: Set Up Output Directory and File Path
Prepare a directory for storing JPG outputs.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "JPG_OUTPUT");
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "IGS_result.jpg");

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_IGS"))
{
    JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.View(options); // Render the IGS file into JPG format
}
```

### Rendering IGS to PNG
**Overview**: Convert IGS files to PNG images for high-resolution outputs.

#### Step 1: Prepare Output Directory and File Path

```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "PNG_OUTPUT");
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "IGS_result.png");

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_IGS"))
{
    PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.View(options); // Render the IGS file into PNG format
}
```

### Rendering IGS to PDF
**Overview**: Generate a portable PDF document from an IGS file.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path

```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "PDF_OUTPUT");
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "IGS_result.pdf");

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_IGS"))
{
    PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.View(options); // Render the IGS file into PDF format
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Issues**: Ensure paths are correctly set and accessible.
- **License Problems**: Confirm that your license is applied correctly if you encounter feature restrictions.
