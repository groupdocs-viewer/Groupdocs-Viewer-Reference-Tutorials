## Import Namespaces

To begin using GroupDocs.Viewer in your .NET application, import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp

string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class by passing the path of the document you want to render. Then, define the `HtmlViewOptions` and specify whether to render hidden pages.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.pptx"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.RenderHiddenPages = true;
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.pptx"` with the path to your document.

## Step 3: Render the Document

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object and pass the rendering options.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display Output Directory
