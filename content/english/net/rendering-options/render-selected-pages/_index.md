## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into how to utilize **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** to render selected pages from a document. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting, this step-by-step guide will walk you through the process with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Sample Document:** A document file (e.g., DOCX, PDF) for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces

In your C# code file, import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods. You can do this using the `using` directive:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

Now, let's break down the example code into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

First, define the directory where you want the rendered pages to be saved and the format for the file paths of the rendered pages.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class, passing the path of the document you want to render as an argument. Then, set up the `HtmlViewOptions` for rendering.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.DOCX"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.DOCX"` with the path to your document.

## Step 3: Render Selected Pages

Specify the page numbers you want to render. In this case, we are rendering pages 1 and 3. Then, call the `View` method on the `Viewer` object, passing the options and page numbers as arguments.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options, 1, 3);
```

## Step 4: Display Output Result

Finally, display a message indicating the successful rendering of the document and the location where the output files are saved.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to render selected pages from a document using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. With this knowledge, you can now integrate document rendering capabilities into your .NET applications with ease.
