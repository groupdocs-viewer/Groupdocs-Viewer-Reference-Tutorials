## Prerequisites
Before delving into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Installation of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET

### 2. Basic Knowledge of .NET Framework
A fundamental understanding of the .NET framework is essential to comprehend the concepts and implement the steps outlined in this tutorial. If you're new to .NET, consider familiarizing yourself with its fundamentals through online resources or tutorials.
### 3. Familiarity with C# Programming Language
Since GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET operates within the C# environment, familiarity with the C# programming language is crucial. Make sure you have a working knowledge of C# syntax, data types, and object-oriented programming principles.
### 4. Document Files with Notes
Ensure that you have document files containing notes that you intend to render using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. Supported formats include but are not limited to PDF, DOCX, PPTX, etc.

## Import Namespaces
Now that you have the prerequisites in place, let's proceed with importing the necessary namespaces to kickstart the document rendering process.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```
The System.IO namespace provides classes for reading from and writing to files and streams, which will be utilized for managing file paths during the rendering process.

Now, let's break down the process of rendering documents with notes into a series of step-by-step instructions.
## Step 1: Define Output Directory
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Specify the directory where you want the rendered document files to be saved. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to write to this directory.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
Define the file path format for individual pages of the rendered document. This format will determine how the pages are named and organized in the output directory.
## Step 3: Initialize Viewer Object
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.PPTX_WITH_NOTES))
```
Initialize a Viewer object by providing the path to the document file with notes. Replace `TestFiles.PPTX_WITH_NOTES` with the actual path to your document file.
## Step 4: Configure HTML View Options
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.RenderNotes = true;
```
Configure HTML view options for rendering the document. Enable the rendering of notes by setting the `RenderNotes` property to `true`.
## Step 5: Render Document
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
Invoke the `View` method of the Viewer object, passing the configured HTML view options. This will initiate the rendering process for the document with notes.
## Step 6: Display Output Directory
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
Display a message indicating successful rendering and provide the path to the output directory where the rendered document files are located.

## Conclusion
