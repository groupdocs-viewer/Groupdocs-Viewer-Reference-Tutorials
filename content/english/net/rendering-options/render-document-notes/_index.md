## Introduction

In the realm of document manipulation and viewing, **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** stands as a robust solution, offering seamless integration and powerful functionalities. This tutorial aims to guide you through the process of rendering documents with notes using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just diving into the world of .NET, this step-by-step guide will help you navigate the intricacies of document rendering with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Document Files with Notes:** Have document files containing notes that you intend to render (e.g., PDF, DOCX, PPTX).

## Import Namespaces

Now that you have the prerequisites in place, let's proceed with importing the necessary namespaces to kickstart the document rendering process.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

Let's break down the process of rendering documents with notes into a series of step-by-step instructions.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

First, specify the directory where you want the rendered document files to be saved and the format for the individual page file paths.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Initialize a `Viewer` object with the path to your document file. Then, configure the `HtmlViewOptions` to enable the rendering of notes.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE_WITH_NOTES.pptx"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.RenderNotes = true;
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE_WITH_NOTES.pptx"` with the path to your document.

## Step 3: Render the Document

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object, passing the configured HTML view options. This will initiate the rendering process for the document with its notes.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display Output Directory

Finally, display a message indicating the successful rendering and provide the path to the output directory where the rendered document files are located.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
