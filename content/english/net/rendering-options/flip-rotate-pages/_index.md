Let's break down the process of flipping and rotating pages using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET into simple steps.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path

First, define the directory where you want the output file to be saved and specify the full path for the output file.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "output.pdf");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure PDF View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class by passing the path to the document you want to view. Then, set up the `PdfViewOptions` and specify the page rotation.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.docx"))
{
    PdfViewOptions viewOptions = new PdfViewOptions(outputFilePath);
    viewOptions.RotatePage(1, Rotation.On90Degree);
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.docx"` with the path to your document. In this example, we are rotating the first page by 90 degrees.

## Step 3: Render the Document

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object and pass the configured view options.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(viewOptions);
```

## Step 4: Display Success Message

Finally, inform the user that the document has been successfully rendered and specify the output directory for verification.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
