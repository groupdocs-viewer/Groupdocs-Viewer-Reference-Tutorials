Now, let's walk through the process of replacing missing fonts in documents using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.
## Step 1: Define Output Directory
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Set the directory where the rendered document pages will be saved.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format

string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
Specify the format for naming the output HTML files. In this example, each page will be saved as an HTML file with the naming convention "page_{page_number}.html".
## Step 3: Initialize Viewer Object
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.MISSING_FONT_PPTX))
```
Initialize a new instance of the Viewer class, passing the path to the document file (in this case, a PowerPoint presentation with missing fonts) as a parameter.
## Step 4: Set HTML View Options
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.DefaultFontName = "Courier New";
```
Create an instance of HtmlViewOptions and configure it to embed resources within HTML output. Specify a default font name to use as a replacement for missing fonts.
## Step 5: Render Document
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
Invoke the View method of the Viewer object, passing the HTML view options. This will render the document pages using the specified options.
## Step 6: Display Output Path
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
Print a message indicating the successful rendering of the document and provide the path where the output HTML files are saved.
