## Introduction

In the world of .NET development, efficient document handling is crucial. **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** provides a powerful solution for viewing various document formats within your .NET applications. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET to replace missing fonts in documents. Whether you are dealing with PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, or Word documents, GroupDocs.Viewer simplifies the process, ensuring that your documents are rendered accurately, even when fonts are missing.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Sample Document:** A document file (e.g., PPTX, DOCX) with missing fonts for testing.

## Import Namespaces

In your C# code, import the necessary namespaces to access GroupDocs.Viewer functionalities.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

Now, let's walk through the process of replacing missing fonts in documents using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

First, set the directory where the rendered document pages will be saved and specify the format for naming the output HTML files.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Initialize a `Viewer` object with the path to your document. Then, create an instance of `HtmlViewOptions` and specify a default font name to use as a replacement for any missing fonts.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE_MISSING_FONT.pptx"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.DefaultFontName = "Courier New";
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE_MISSING_FONT.pptx"` with the path to your document.

## Step 3: Render the Document

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object, passing the configured HTML view options. This will render the document pages using the specified options.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display Output Path

Finally, print a message indicating the successful rendering of the document and provide the path where the output HTML files are saved.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
