One such tool that facilitates seamless document rendering is **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET**. This powerful library empowers developers to display various document formats within their applications effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Document Files:** Prepare the document files that you intend to render.

## Import Namespaces

To begin integrating GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET into your project, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This step is crucial for accessing the library's functionality within your codebase.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

Now, let's dive into rendering a specified number of consecutive pages from a document using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and Page File Path Format

First, specify the directory where you want the rendered pages to be saved and the format for the file paths of the rendered pages.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Define the Page Range

Specify the range of consecutive pages you want to render. In this case, we are rendering pages 1 to 3.

```csharp
int[] range = Enumerable.Range(1, 3).ToArray();
```

## Step 3: Initialize Viewer and Render Document Pages

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class, passing the path to the document file as a parameter. Then, configure the `HtmlViewOptions` and call the `View` method, specifying the page range to render.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.DOCX"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.View(options, range);
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.DOCX"` with the path to your document.

## Step 4: Display Rendered Output

Finally, display a success message indicating that the document has been rendered successfully and inform the user about the output directory where the rendered pages are saved.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
