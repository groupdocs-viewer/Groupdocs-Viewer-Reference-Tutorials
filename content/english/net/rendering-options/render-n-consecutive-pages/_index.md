## Import Namespaces
To begin integrating GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET into your project, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This step is crucial for accessing the library's functionality within your codebase.
## Step 1: Import GroupDocs.Viewer Namespace
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```
## Step 2: Import System.IO Namespace
```csharp
using System.IO;
```

Now that you have set up the prerequisites and imported the required namespaces, let's dive into rendering a specified number of consecutive pages from a document using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.
## Step 1: Define Output Directory
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Specify the directory where you want the rendered pages to be saved.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
Set the format for the file paths of the rendered pages. In this example, the pages will be saved as HTML files with names like "page_1.html", "page_2.html", etc.
## Step 3: Define Page Range
```csharp
int[] range = Enumerable.Range(1, 3).ToArray();
```
Specify the range of consecutive pages you want to render. In this case, we are rendering pages 1 to 3.
## Step 4: Render Document Pages
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_DOCX))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.View(options, range);
}
```
Create an instance of the `Viewer` class, passing the path to the document file as a parameter. Then, configure HTML view options and call the `View` method, specifying the page range to render.
## Step 5: Display Rendered Output
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
Finally, display a success message indicating that the document has been rendered successfully and inform the user about the output directory where the rendered pages are saved.
