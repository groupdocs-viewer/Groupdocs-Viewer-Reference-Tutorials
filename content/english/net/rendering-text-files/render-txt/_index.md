Specify the full path for the HTML output file.
## Step 2: Render Text Files to Multi-Pages HTML
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_TXT))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFileFullPath);
    viewer.View(options);
}
```
Instantiate a `Viewer` object with the path to the text file. Configure `HtmlViewOptions` for embedded resources and render the text file into multi-pages HTML.
## Step 3: Define Single-Page HTML Output Path
```csharp
pageFileFullPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "Txt_result_single_page.html");
```
Specify the full path for the single-page HTML output file.
## Step 4: Render Text Files to Single-Page HTML
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_2_TXT))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFileFullPath);
    options.RenderToSinglePage = true;
    viewer.View(options);
}
```
Instantiate a `Viewer` object with the path to the text file. Configure `HtmlViewOptions` for embedded resources and set `RenderToSinglePage` to true. Render the text file into a single-page HTML.
## Step 5: Define JPG Output Path
```csharp
pageFileFullPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "Txt_result.jpg");
```
Specify the full path for the JPG output file.
## Step 6: Render Text Files to JPG
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_TXT))
{
    JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFileFullPath);
    viewer.View(options);
}
```
Instantiate a `Viewer` object with the path to the text file. Configure `JpgViewOptions` for the output path and render the text file into JPG format.
## Step 7: Define PNG Output Path
```csharp
pageFileFullPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "Txt_result.png");
```
Specify the full path for the PNG output file.
## Step 8: Render Text Files to PNG
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_TXT))
{
    PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFileFullPath);
    viewer.View(options);
}
```
Instantiate a `Viewer` object with the path to the text file. Configure `PngViewOptions` for the output path and render the text file into PNG format.
## Step 9: Define PDF Output Path
```csharp
pageFileFullPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "Txt_result.pdf");
```
Specify the full path for the PDF output file.
## Step 10: Render Text Files to PDF
