        using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(@"C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Document.mpp"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Viewer initialized successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we'll break down the steps to retrieve view information from an MS Project document.

### Retrieve View Information for HTML Representation
This feature allows you to extract details like project start/end dates and page count, crucial for understanding project timelines in your application.

#### Step 1: Initialize Viewer
Begin by setting up the viewer instance with your MS Project file. This acts as a gateway to access various view information features.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(@"C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Document.mpp"))
{
    // Proceed to retrieve view information
}
```

#### Step 2: Get View Info for HTML Representation
Use `GetViewInfo` method with `ViewInfoOptions.ForHtmlView()` to fetch the required data.

```csharp
ProjectManagementViewInfo info = viewer.GetViewInfo(ViewInfoOptions.ForHtmlView()) as ProjectManagementViewInfo;
```

#### Step 3: Display Key Information
Extract and display essential details from the retrieved view information.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Document type is: " + info.FileType);
Console.WriteLine("Pages count: " + info.Pages.Count);
Console.WriteLine("Project start date: {0}", info.StartDate);
Console.WriteLine("Project end date: {0}", info.EndDate);
```
