### Installation Instructions

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Viewer -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Viewer --version 25.3.0
```

### Acquiring a License

GroupDocs.Viewer offers several licensing options:
- **Free Trial**: Explore basic functionalities.
- **Temporary License**: Full-feature access during evaluation.
- **Purchase**: For long-term usage, consider purchasing a license.

After installation and setting up your license, initialize GroupDocs.Viewer in your application. Here's an example setup:

```csharp

{
    // Use the Viewer functionalities here.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into key features for a structured approach.

### Retrieve View Information for Archive Files

Understanding your archive's structure is crucial. Hereâ€™s how to achieve this:

#### Initialize the Viewer Object

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class with your archive file path:

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_ZIP_WITH_FOLDERS";
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath))
{
    // Your code for processing will go here.
}
```

#### Obtain View Information

Retrieve view information, formatted as JPG images:

```csharp
ViewInfo info = viewer.GetViewInfo(ViewInfoOptions.ForJpgView());
Console.WriteLine("File type: " + info.FileType);
Console.WriteLine("Pages count: " + info.Pages.Count);
```

#### Display Root Folder Information

For a comprehensive overview, print the root folder details:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Folders:");
Console.WriteLine(" - /");
```

#### Recursively Read and Print Subfolder Names

To explore subfolders within your archive, use this recursive method:

```csharp
string rootFolder = string.Empty;
ReadArchiveFolders(viewer, rootFolder);

private static void ReadArchiveFolders(Viewer viewer, string folder)
{
    ViewInfoOptions options = ViewInfoOptions.ForJpgView();
    options.ArchiveOptions.Folder = folder;

    ArchiveViewInfo viewInfo = viewer.GetViewInfo(options) as ArchiveViewInfo;
    foreach (string subFolder in viewInfo.Folders)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($" - {subFolder}");
        ReadArchiveFolders(viewer, subFolder);
    }
}
```

### Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET can be used in various scenarios:
- **Document Management Systems**: Automatically extract and display archive structures.
- **Content Delivery Platforms**: Provide previews of archived content to users.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Analyze folder hierarchies within archives for business insights.

Integration with other frameworks like ASP.NET or WPF is straightforward, allowing seamless incorporation into existing systems.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Efficiently manage memory and handle large files.
- **Memory Management Best Practices**: Dispose of `Viewer` objects properly to free up resources promptly.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to utilize GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET to retrieve detailed information from archive files. Implementing these features can significantly enhance your document management capabilities.

### Next Steps

Consider exploring more advanced features offered by GroupDocs.Viewer or integrating it with other components of your application. Experiment with different file types and complex folder structures to deepen your understanding.
