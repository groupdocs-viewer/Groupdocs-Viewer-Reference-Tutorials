## Implementation Guide

We’ll break down the process of retrieving and printing worksheet names into manageable steps.

### Feature: Retrieve and Print Worksheet Names
This feature focuses on extracting and displaying all worksheet names from an Excel document using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. Follow these implementation steps:

#### Step 1: Initialize Viewer with a File Path
Begin by initializing the `Viewer` object with your spreadsheet file path.
```csharp
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsx";
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
{
    // Proceed to the next step...
}
```

#### Step 2: Set Up ViewInfoOptions for HTML View
Configure `ViewInfoOptions` to set up the HTML view of your spreadsheet. This configuration is essential for rendering the document correctly.
```csharp
ViewInfoOptions viewInfoOptions = ViewInfoOptions.ForHtmlView();
viewInfoOptions.SpreadsheetOptions = SpreadsheetOptions.ForOnePagePerSheet(); // Each sheet as one page.
```

#### Step 3: Retrieve View Information
Obtain the `ViewInfo` object, which contains details about the document's structure and pages.
```csharp
ViewInfo viewInfo = viewer.GetViewInfo(viewInfoOptions);
Console.WriteLine("Worksheets:");
```

#### Step 4: Iterate Over Each Page and Print Worksheet Names
Finally, iterate over each page to extract and print worksheet names.
```csharp
foreach (Page page in viewInfo.Pages)
{
    Console.WriteLine($" - Worksheet {page.Number} name '{page.Name}'");
}
```
