# How to Use GroupDocs.Viewer .NET to Disable Text Selection When Rendering PDFs as HTML

## Introduction

Protecting sensitive information in your PDF documents is crucial, especially when converting them into an HTML format. Unauthorized text selection can lead to potential misuse or distribution of content. This tutorial will guide you through using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET to disable text selection during the conversion process.

By leveraging the `RenderTextAsImage` feature in GroupDocs.Viewer, we can convert text into images within HTML output, thereby enhancing document security and control over content distribution.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET
- Implementing the RenderTextAsImage option to disable text selection
- Configuring rendering options and embedding resources
- Practical applications of this feature in various scenarios

Let's get started with the prerequisites you need.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize GroupDocs.Viewer in your project:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Viewer;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/TestFiles.ONE_PAGE_TEXT_PDF";
        
        using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
        {
            // Initialization code here
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Disable Text Selection in PDF-to-HTML Conversion

#### Overview
By setting the `RenderTextAsImage` option, you can render text as images within HTML output, preventing users from selecting and copying text.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Initialize Viewer**
Start by creating an instance of the `Viewer` class with your PDF document path:
```csharp
string filePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "TestFiles.ONE_PAGE_TEXT_PDF");
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
{
    // Continue to configure options here...
}
```
**Configure HTML Options**
Set up `HtmlViewOptions` to embed resources within each page's HTML:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");

HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```
**Disable Text Selection**
Enable the `RenderTextAsImage` option to render text as images:
```csharp
options.PdfOptions.RenderTextAsImage = true;
```
**Render Document**
Finally, render your document with these settings:
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: If the output HTML doesn't reflect changes, ensure paths are correctly set.
- **Performance Tip**: Large PDFs may increase rendering time; consider optimizing content before conversion.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Viewer offers versatile applications:
1. **Secure Document Sharing:** Ideal for sharing proprietary or confidential documents online without risk of text copying.
2. **Digital Publishing:** Enhance digital magazines or newsletters by preventing unauthorized distribution of text.
3. **Legal and Financial Documents:** Safeguard sensitive information in legal contracts or financial reports.

Integration possibilities include embedding within .NET web applications, enhancing existing document management systems, or customizing content delivery platforms.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Viewer:
- Limit the size of PDFs being processed.
- Utilize caching mechanisms for frequently accessed documents.
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of Viewer instances promptly after use.

Adhering to best practices in .NET memory management can prevent resource leakage and improve application responsiveness.
