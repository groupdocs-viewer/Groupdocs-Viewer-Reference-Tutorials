## Introduction

Protecting sensitive information in your PDF documents is crucial, especially when converting them to HTML format for web viewing. Unauthorized text selection can lead to the potential misuse or distribution of your content. This tutorial will guide you through using **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** to disable text selection during the PDF to HTML conversion process.

By leveraging the `RenderTextAsImage` feature in GroupDocs.Viewer, you can convert the text in your PDF into images within the HTML output, thereby enhancing document security and control over content distribution.

You will learn how to:
- Set up GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET in your project.
- Implement the `RenderTextAsImage` option to disable text selection.
- Configure rendering options and embed resources.
- Apply this feature in practical scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or another .NET development environment.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Version 25.3.0 or later. You can install it via NuGet.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** A solid understanding of C# and the .NET framework.

### Install via NuGet

Use the following command in your Package Manager Console:
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Viewer -Version 25.3.0
```
Or via the .NET CLI:
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Viewer --version 25.3.0
```

### Licensing

GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET requires a license for full functionality. You can get a [free temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for evaluation or purchase a [full license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

## Disable Text Selection in PDF-to-HTML Conversion

By setting the `RenderTextAsImage` option, you can render the text in your PDF as images within the HTML output, which prevents users from selecting and copying the text.

### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

First, specify the directory where the rendered HTML files will be saved.

```csharp
using System.IO;

// Define the output directory
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
// Define the format for the output file path
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` with your desired path.

### Step 2: Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of `HtmlViewOptions` and enable the `RenderTextAsImage` option.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;

// Create HTML view options for embedded resources
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
// Disable text selection by rendering text as an image
options.PdfOptions.RenderTextAsImage = true;
```
**Explanation:** The `ForEmbeddedResources` method ensures that all resources like images and fonts are embedded directly into the HTML file. Setting `RenderTextAsImage` to `true` instructs the viewer to convert all text into images.

### Step 3: Load and Render the Document

Initialize the `Viewer` object with your PDF file and call the `View()` method with the configured options.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Viewer;

// Path to your PDF file
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE.pdf";

try
{
    using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath))
    {
        // Render the document with text selection disabled
        viewer.View(options);
    }
    System.Console.WriteLine("\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {0}", outputDirectory);
}
catch (System.Exception exp)
{
    System.Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + exp.Message);
}
```
**Troubleshooting:**
*   **Incorrect Paths:** Ensure that the file paths are correctly set.
*   **Performance:** Rendering large PDFs with this option may take longer. Consider optimizing your content before conversion.

## Practical Applications

-   **Secure Document Sharing:** Share proprietary or confidential documents online without the risk of text being copied.
-   **Digital Publishing:** Protect the content of digital magazines or newsletters from unauthorized distribution.
-   **Legal and Financial Documents:** Safeguard sensitive information in legal contracts or financial reports.

## Performance Considerations

-   **File Size:** Rendering text as images will increase the size of the output HTML files.
-   **Resource Management:** Use a `using` statement to ensure the `Viewer` object is properly disposed of.
-   **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed documents to improve performance.

This feature is crucial for protecting sensitive information and maintaining control over your document's distribution.
