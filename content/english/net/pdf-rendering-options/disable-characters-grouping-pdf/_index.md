## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET from the [official download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
3. Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language fundamentals.
4. Document Files: Prepare the document files you intend to render, such as PDFs or images.

## Import Namespaces
Firstly, let's import the necessary namespaces into our project. These namespaces will provide access to the functionalities we need from GroupDocs.Viewer.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

Now, let's dissect the example provided into manageable steps.
## Step 1: Define Output Directory
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Here, we set up a variable to store the directory where the rendered HTML pages will be saved.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
This step establishes the format for naming the HTML files generated for each page of the document.
## Step 3: Initialize Viewer Object
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.HIEROGLYPHS_PDF))
```
Here, we initialize the Viewer object, passing the path to the PDF file we want to render.
## Step 4: Configure HTML View Options
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.PdfOptions.DisableCharsGrouping = true;
```
In this step, we set up HTML view options, specifying that the characters grouping in the PDF should be disabled.
## Step 5: Render the Document
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
Finally, we call the `View` method on the Viewer object, passing the configured options to render the document.
## Step 6: Display Output Directory
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
This step outputs a message indicating the successful rendering of the document and provides the location where the output can be found.
