## Introduction
GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET is a powerful document rendering API that allows developers to integrate document viewing capabilities into their .NET applications effortlessly. One of the key functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Viewer is the ability to disable text selection in PDF documents. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to prevent users from copying text from sensitive documents, ensuring document security and integrity.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the step-by-step guide on how to disable text selection in PDF using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Installation of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: Ensure that you have downloaded and installed GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
2. Document Directory: Prepare a directory where your documents will be stored. You'll need to specify this directory in the code snippet to render the PDF document.

## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

Now, let's break down the process of disabling text selection in a PDF document using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Specify Output Directory
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
In this step, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the directory path where your PDF document is located.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
This step defines the format for the file paths of the rendered HTML pages. Each page of the PDF document will be converted to an HTML file with a sequential page number.
## Step 3: Render PDF Document with Text Selection Disabled
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("Path to Your PDF Document"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.PdfOptions.RenderTextAsImage = true;
    viewer.View(options);
}
```
Replace `"Path to Your PDF Document"` with the actual path to your PDF file. This code snippet initializes a `Viewer` object, configures HTML view options to embed resources, and disables text selection by setting `RenderTextAsImage` property to `true`.
## Step 4: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
After rendering the PDF document, this step displays a success message along with the directory where the rendered HTML pages are stored.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to disable text selection in PDF documents using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can seamlessly integrate this feature into your .NET applications, ensuring document security and enhancing user experience.
