## Introduction

**GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** is a powerful tool that enables developers to seamlessly integrate document rendering capabilities into their .NET applications. Whether you need to render CAD drawings, PDFs, Microsoft Office documents, or more, GroupDocs.Viewer provides a comprehensive solution.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A basic understanding of the C# programming language.
*   A .NET development environment set up on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   Access to the [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET documentation](https://reference.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/) for reference.

## Import Namespaces

To start using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET, you need to import the required namespaces in your project.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Results;
```

Let's break down the provided example into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and Page File Path Format

First, define the directory where you want to save the rendered output and the format for the file path of each page.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class with the path to your CAD drawing. Then, configure the `HtmlViewOptions` for rendering.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.dwg"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    
    // The layer configuration will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.dwg"` with the path to your CAD file.

## Step 3: Define CAD Layers to Render

Specify the layers you want to include in the rendered output.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
options.CadOptions.Layers = new List<Layer>
{
    new Layer("QUADRANT")
};
```
In this example, we are only rendering the "QUADRANT" layer.

## Step 4: Render the Document

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object with the configured options.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 5: Display the Output Location

Finally, inform the user about the location where the rendered document is saved.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

With GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET, rendering CAD drawings in your .NET applications becomes a seamless process. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily integrate document rendering capabilities into your projects.
