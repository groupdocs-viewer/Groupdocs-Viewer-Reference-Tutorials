## Introduction
In the world of software development, handling CAD drawings efficiently is crucial. Whether you're building applications for architects, engineers, or designers, providing a seamless viewing experience for CAD files can greatly enhance user satisfaction. GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET offers a powerful solution to effortlessly integrate CAD file viewing capabilities into your .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of getting view information for CAD drawings using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET
First and foremost, you need to have GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the latest version from the [GroupDocs website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
### 2. Basic Understanding of .NET Framework
Familiarity with the .NET framework and C# programming language is essential to follow along with this tutorial.
### 3. Set Up a Development Environment
Ensure you have a development environment set up with Visual Studio or any other .NET-compatible IDE.

## Import Namespaces
In your C# project, import the necessary namespaces to utilize GroupDocs.Viewer functionalities.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Results;
```

## Step 1: Define View Information Options
```csharp
ViewInfoOptions viewInfoOptions = ViewInfoOptions.ForHtmlView();
```
In this step, we initialize an instance of `ViewInfoOptions` to specify the options for retrieving view information. We use `ForHtmlView()` method to indicate that we want to retrieve information for HTML view.
## Step 2: Configure CAD Rendering Options
```csharp
viewInfoOptions.CadOptions.RenderLayouts = true;
```
Here, we set `RenderLayouts` property to `true` to include all layouts. This ensures that all layouts within the CAD file will be rendered.
## Step 3: Retrieve CAD View Information
```csharp
CadViewInfo info = viewer.GetViewInfo(viewInfoOptions) as CadViewInfo;
```
We call `GetViewInfo()` method on the viewer object, passing the `viewInfoOptions` as a parameter to retrieve view information for the CAD file. We cast the returned `ViewInfo` object to `CadViewInfo` type.
## Step 4: Display Document Type and Page Count
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Document type is: " + info.FileType);
Console.WriteLine("Pages count: " + info.Pages.Count);
```
In this step, we print the document type and the total number of pages in the CAD file to the console.
## Step 5: Display Layouts and Layers
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nLayouts:");
foreach (Layout layout in info.Layouts)
    Console.WriteLine(layout);
Console.WriteLine("\nLayers:");
foreach (Layer layer in info.Layers)
    Console.WriteLine(layer);
```
Finally, we iterate through the layouts and layers retrieved from the CAD file and print them to the console.

## Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you've learned how to utilize GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET to obtain view information for CAD drawings seamlessly. Integrating this capability into your .NET applications can significantly enhance user experience and streamline CAD file handling.
