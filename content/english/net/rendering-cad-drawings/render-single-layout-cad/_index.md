## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, handling and viewing CAD drawings is a common requirement. **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** simplifies this task by providing a comprehensive solution for rendering CAD drawings within .NET applications. In this tutorial, we will delve into rendering a single layout in CAD drawings using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A basic understanding of C# and the .NET framework.
*   **Visual Studio:** Installed on your system.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/) and reference it in your project.
*   Familiarity with CAD file formats and their structures.

## Import Namespaces

First, import the necessary namespaces into your C# code to access GroupDocs.Viewer functionalities.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and Page File Path Format

Specify the directory where you want the rendered output to be saved and the format for the file path of each rendered page.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class provided by GroupDocs.Viewer. Then, configure the `HtmlViewOptions` for rendering the HTML output with embedded resources.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.dwg"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    
    // The layout specification will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.dwg"` with the path to your CAD drawing.

## Step 3: Specify the CAD Layout Name

Specify the name of the CAD layout you want to render.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
options.CadOptions.LayoutName = "Model";
```

## Step 4: Render the CAD Drawing

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object with the specified options.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 5: Display the Success Message

Inform the user about the successful rendering of the source document.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
