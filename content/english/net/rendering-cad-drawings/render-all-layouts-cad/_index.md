## Introduction

In the realm of document management and visualization, **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** stands tall as a versatile solution, empowering developers to effortlessly render various document types within their .NET applications. Among its myriad capabilities lies the ability to efficiently render CAD drawings, including the intricate layouts they entail. In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of leveraging GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET to render all layouts present in CAD drawings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A basic understanding of .NET development.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Installed in your project. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **CAD Drawing Files:** Have the CAD drawing files you intend to render (e.g., DWG files with multiple layouts).
*   **Development Environment:** A configured development environment with the necessary tools and dependencies.

## Import Namespaces

First, ensure that you import the required namespaces into your .NET project. These namespaces provide access to the functionalities needed for rendering CAD drawings with GroupDocs.Viewer.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and Page File Path Format

Specify the directory where you want the rendered output to be saved and the format for the file paths of the rendered pages.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class, passing the path to the CAD drawing file as a parameter. Then, configure the `HtmlViewOptions` to specify that all layouts should be rendered.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.dwg"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.CadOptions.RenderLayouts = true;
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.dwg"` with the path to your CAD file.

## Step 3: Render the CAD Drawing

Invoke the `View` method of the `Viewer` object, passing the configured options to render the CAD drawing.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display the Output Directory

Inform the user about the successful rendering and the location of the output directory.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored how to utilize GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET to render all layouts present in CAD drawings. By following the step-by-step guide and implementing the provided code snippets, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, thereby enhancing your document visualization capabilities.
