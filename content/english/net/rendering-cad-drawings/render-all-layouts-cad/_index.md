## Prerequisites
Before embarking on this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Basic Understanding of .NET Development: Familiarity with .NET development fundamentals will be beneficial in comprehending the implementation steps outlined in this tutorial.
2. Installation of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: Make sure you have installed the GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
3. CAD Drawing Files: Obtain the CAD drawing files you intend to render. These could include DWG files with multiple layouts.
4. Development Environment: Set up your preferred development environment with the necessary tools and dependencies.

## Import Namespaces
Firstly, ensure that you import the required namespaces into your .NET project. These namespaces provide access to the functionalities needed for rendering CAD drawings with GroupDocs.Viewer.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```
## Step 2: Import System.IO Namespace
```csharp
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Specify Output Directory
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Define the directory where you want the rendered output to be saved.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
Set up the format for the file paths of the rendered pages. In this case, the pages will be saved as HTML files.
## Step 3: Instantiate Viewer Object
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_DWG_WITH_LAYOUTS_AND_LAYERS))
```
Create an instance of the Viewer class, passing the path to the CAD drawing file as a parameter.
## Step 4: Configure HTML View Options
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.CadOptions.RenderLayouts = true;
```
Configure the HTML view options, specifying that layouts should be rendered for CAD drawings.
## Step 5: Render CAD Drawing
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
Invoke the View method of the Viewer object, passing the configured options to render the CAD drawing.
## Step 6: Display Output Directory
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
Inform the user about the successful rendering and the location of the output directory.
