# Enable Caching for Faster Document Processing

## Introduction
In the realm of .NET document processing, optimizing performance is paramount. Imagine a scenario where you need to render multiple document pages swiftly. This is where caching comes into play. In this tutorial, we'll delve into leveraging caching to enhance the processing speed of documents using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET SDK: Download and install the SDK from the [GroupDocs.Viewer website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
2. Development Environment: Set up your preferred .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio.
3. Sample Document: Have a sample document ready for testing purposes.

## Importing Namespaces
To begin, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Caching;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and Cache Path
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string cachePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "cache");
```
Here, we define the output directory where the rendered pages will be saved, along with the cache path.
## Step 2: Initialize File Cache
```csharp
FileCache cache = new FileCache(cachePath);
```
Initialize a file cache using the specified cache path.
## Step 3: Configure Viewer Settings
```csharp
ViewerSettings settings = new ViewerSettings(cache);
```
Configure viewer settings, passing the initialized cache.
## Step 4: Initialize Viewer Instance
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_DOCX, settings))
```
Initialize the viewer instance with the sample document and configured settings.
## Step 5: Define HTML View Options
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```
Define HTML view options for embedded resources, specifying the page file path format.
## Step 6: Render Document and Measure Performance
```csharp
Stopwatch stopWatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
viewer.View(options);
stopWatch.Stop();
```
Render the document using the specified options and measure the time taken.
## Step 7: Reuse Cached Data for Faster Rendering
```csharp
stopWatch.Restart();
viewer.View(options);
stopWatch.Stop();
```
Re-render the document using cached data to observe the performance improvement.
## Step 8: Output Rendered Document
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
Notify the user about the successful rendering and the location of the output directory.

## Conclusion
Caching plays a vital role in optimizing document processing performance in .NET applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can efficiently enable caching in GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET, thereby accelerating document rendering.
