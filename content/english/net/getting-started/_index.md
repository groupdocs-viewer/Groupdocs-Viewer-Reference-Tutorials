## Why GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET?

Before diving into the technical setup, let's quickly understand what makes GroupDocs.Viewer a developer favorite:

- **Zero Dependencies**: No need to install Microsoft Office, Adobe Reader, or any other third-party software
- **High Performance**: Optimized rendering engine that handles large documents efficiently  
- **Flexible Licensing**: Multiple licensing options to fit your project's needs and budget
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across different .NET frameworks and platforms

## Understanding Your Licensing Options

The first step in your GroupDocs.Viewer .NET getting started journey involves choosing and implementing the right licensing approach. Here's when to use each method:

### File-Based Licensing
Perfect for desktop applications or scenarios where you have direct file system access. This is the most straightforward approach and works great for:
- Windows Forms applications
- WPF desktop apps  
- Self-hosted web applications with file system access

### Stream-Based Licensing
Ideal for cloud applications, containerized environments, or when you need more flexibility in how you store and access your license. Consider this option for:
- Azure App Services or AWS Lambda functions
- Docker containers where file paths might vary
- Applications that store licenses in databases or cloud storage

### Metered Licensing
Best for applications with variable usage patterns or when you want to track document processing consumption. This pay-as-you-go approach works well for:
- SaaS applications with different user tiers
- Applications with unpredictable document viewing volumes
- Projects where you need detailed usage analytics

## Step-by-Step Integration Tutorials

Our comprehensive tutorials will guide you through each licensing method with practical examples and real-world scenarios.

### [Set License from File](./set-license-from-file/)
Learn the most common licensing approach used in enterprise applications. This tutorial covers everything from basic setup to advanced configuration options, including how to handle license validation errors and implement fallback mechanisms.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to properly structure your license file placement
- Error handling for missing or invalid license files

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Even experienced developers run into challenges when integrating new libraries. Here are the most common GroupDocs.Viewer .NET integration issues and their solutions:

### License Validation Problems
**Issue**: "License file not found" or "Invalid license" errors
**Solution**: Always verify your license file path and ensure the license hasn't expired. Use try-catch blocks around license initialization and implement proper error logging.

### Performance Considerations
**Issue**: Slow document rendering or high memory usage
**Solution**: Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed documents and use the appropriate rendering options for your use case. For large documents, enable progressive loading.

### Deployment Challenges
**Issue**: Application works locally but fails in production
**Solution**: Ensure all required dependencies are included in your deployment package and verify that your license is properly configured for the production environment.

## Best Practices for Production Deployment

### Security Recommendations
- Never store license files in publicly accessible directories
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration data
- Implement proper access controls for license management endpoints

### Performance Optimization
- Initialize the license once during application startup, not on every request
- Use dependency injection to manage GroupDocs.Viewer instances efficiently
- Consider implementing document caching for frequently accessed files

### Error Handling and Monitoring
- Implement comprehensive logging for license-related operations
- Set up monitoring alerts for license expiration
- Create fallback mechanisms for license validation failures
