## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
- **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
- **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
- **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
- **Sample Outlook Data File:** An OST file for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project. This step ensures that you have access to the required classes and methods from the GroupDocs.Viewer library.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

First, specify the directory where you want the rendered HTML pages to be saved and the format for the file paths of the rendered pages.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```

**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of the `Viewer` class with the path to your Outlook data file. Then, configure the `HtmlViewOptions` to limit the number of items to render in each folder.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.OST"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.OutlookOptions.MaxItemsInFolder = 3;
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```

**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.OST"` with the path to your OST file. In this example, we set `MaxItemsInFolder` to `3`, which limits the number of items (such as emails or folders) to render within each folder of the Outlook data file.

## Step 3: Render the Document

Call the `View` method of the `Viewer` instance, passing in the configured HTML view options. This method renders the Outlook data file according to the specified options, generating HTML pages for each item.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display Output Directory Path

Finally, you can print the path to the output directory where the rendered HTML pages are saved.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored how to limit the number of items rendered in Outlook data files using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can easily integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, providing users with a streamlined document viewing experience.
