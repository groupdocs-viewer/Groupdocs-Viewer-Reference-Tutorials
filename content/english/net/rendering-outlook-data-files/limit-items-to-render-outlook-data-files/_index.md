## Introduction
Groupdocs.Viewer for .NET is a powerful tool for developers looking to integrate document viewing capabilities into their .NET applications seamlessly. Whether you need to display PDFs, Microsoft Office documents, or Outlook data files within your application, Groupdocs.Viewer offers a robust solution. In this tutorial, we will delve into how to limit the number of items rendered specifically in Outlook data files, using step-by-step instructions.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Visual Studio IDE: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Groupdocs.Viewer for .NET: Download and install the Groupdocs.Viewer library from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language fundamentals.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project. This step ensures that you have access to the required classes and methods from the Groupdocs.Viewer library.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Directory
First, specify the directory where you want the rendered HTML pages to be saved. This directory will contain the individual HTML files for each rendered page of the Outlook data file.
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to the directory where you want to save the rendered HTML pages.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
Next, define the format for the file paths of the rendered HTML pages. Each HTML page will be saved with a filename that follows this format, with `{0}` being replaced by the page number.
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
This step ensures that each rendered page is saved with a unique filename based on its page number.
## Step 3: Limit Items in Outlook Data File
Now, create an instance of the `Viewer` class and specify the path to the Outlook data file (`*.ost`) that you want to render.
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_OST))
```
Replace `TestFiles.SAMPLE_OST` with the path to your Outlook data file.
## Step 4: Configure HTML View Options
Configure the HTML view options, including specifying the maximum number of items to render in each folder of the Outlook data file.
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.OutlookOptions.MaxItemsInFolder = 3;
```
In this example, we set the `MaxItemsInFolder` property to `3`, limiting the number of items (such as emails or folders) to render within each folder of the Outlook data file.
## Step 5: Render Document
Finally, call the `View` method of the `Viewer` instance, passing in the HTML view options.
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
This method renders the Outlook data file according to the specified options, generating HTML pages for each item.
## Step 6: Display Output Directory Path
Optionally, you can print the path to the output directory where the rendered HTML pages are saved.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to limit the number of items rendered in Outlook data files using Groupdocs.Viewer for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can easily integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, providing users with a streamlined document viewing experience.
