## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:
1. GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: Make sure you have installed GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
2. .NET Framework: You need to have the .NET framework installed on your machine.
3. Basic understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial to follow along with the tutorial.

## Import Namespaces
Firstly, let's import the necessary namespaces to our C# code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the directory path where you want the rendered documents to be saved.
## Step 2: Define Page File Path Format
```csharp
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
This line defines the format for the file paths of each rendered page. In this example, it will generate HTML files named `page_1.html`, `page_2.html`, and so on.
## Step 3: Initialize Viewer Object
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_OST_SUBFOLDERS))
```
Here, we initialize a `Viewer` object with the path to the sample Outlook folder.
## Step 4: Define HTML View Options
```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
options.OutlookOptions.Folder = "Входящие";
```
We create an instance of `HtmlViewOptions` and specify the format for embedded resources. Additionally, we set the Outlook folder to be rendered as `"Входящие"` (Incoming).
## Step 5: Render the Document
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
This line triggers the rendering process with the specified options.
## Step 6: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
After rendering, this message is displayed indicating the successful completion of the rendering process and directs the user to the output directory.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to render specific folders and filter messages in Outlook using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. By following the steps outlined above, you can efficiently manage and display documents within your .NET applications.
