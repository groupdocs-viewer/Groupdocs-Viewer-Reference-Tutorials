## Introduction

In the world of .NET development, efficiently managing and displaying documents is crucial. **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** simplifies this task by providing powerful functionalities for rendering various document formats seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will delve into how to render specific folders and filter messages in Outlook data files (OST) using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   A working knowledge of C# and .NET development.
*   **.NET SDK:** Installed on your machine.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET:** Download the library [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
*   **Sample Outlook Data File:** An OST file with subfolders for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces

First, let's import the necessary namespaces into our C# code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

Define the directory where you want the rendered documents to be saved and the format for the file paths of each rendered page.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path.

## Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure HTML View Options

Initialize a `Viewer` object with the path to your sample Outlook data file. Then, create an instance of `HtmlViewOptions` and specify the Outlook folder to be rendered.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("SAMPLE.OST"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.OutlookOptions.Folder = "Inbox"; // Specify the folder to render
    
    // The rendering process will go here
}
```
**Note:** Replace `"SAMPLE.OST"` with the path to your OST file and `"Inbox"` with the name of the folder you want to render.

## Step 3: Render the Document

This line triggers the rendering process with the specified options.

```csharp
// Inside the using block
viewer.View(options);
```

## Step 4: Display Success Message

After rendering, this message is displayed, indicating the successful completion of the process and directing the user to the output directory.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document rendered successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored how to render specific folders from an Outlook data file using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. By following the steps outlined above, you can efficiently manage and display documents within your .NET applications.
