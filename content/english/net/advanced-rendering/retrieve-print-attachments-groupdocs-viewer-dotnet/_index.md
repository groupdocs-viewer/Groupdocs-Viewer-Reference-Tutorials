- Basic understanding of C# and .NET project structure

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET

To start, install GroupDocs.Viewer in your .NET project using either the NuGet Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI.

### Installation with NuGet Package Manager Console:
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Viewer --version 25.3.0
```

### Installation with .NET CLI:
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Viewer --version 25.3.0
```

Once installed, configure your project to use the library.

#### License Acquisition Steps:
- **Free Trial**: Download a trial version from [GroupDocs Downloads](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/).
- **Temporary License**: Request a temporary license via their [Temporary License Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a full license for access and support on the [GroupDocs Purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

#### Basic Initialization and Setup:
Here's how you can initialize GroupDocs.Viewer in your C# code:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Viewer;

namespace DocumentAttachmentDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize the Viewer object with your document's path
            using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS"))
            {
                // Your code here...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's focus on retrieving and printing document attachments.

### Retrieve All Attachments from a Document

#### Overview
This section demonstrates how to extract all attachments embedded within a document using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

##### Step 1: Initialize the Viewer Object
Create an instance of the `Viewer` class by specifying your document's path. This prepares the environment for processing.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Viewer;

namespace DocumentAttachmentDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Path to your document with attachments
            string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS";

            using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
            {
                // Retrieve attachments in the next step...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### Step 2: Retrieve Attachments from the Document
Use the `GetAttachments` method to fetch all attachments. This returns a list of attachment objects with metadata like name and size.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Viewer;

namespace DocumentAttachmentDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS";

            using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
            {
                // Retrieve attachments
                IList<Attachment> attachments = viewer.GetAttachments();

                // Proceed to print attachment details...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### Step 3: Print Each Attachment’s Details
Iterate over the retrieved list and display each attachment's name and size. This verifies the retrieval process.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Viewer;

namespace DocumentAttachmentDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS";

            using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
            {
                IList<Attachment> attachments = viewer.GetAttachments();

                foreach(Attachment attachment in attachments)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Name: {attachment.Name}"); // Display attachment name
                    Console.WriteLine($"Size: {attachment.Size}");   // Display attachment size
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Document Path Error**: Ensure the document path is correct and accessible.
- **Permission Issues**: Check if your application has read permissions for the specified directory.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where retrieving and printing document attachments can be useful:
1. **Email Management Systems**: Automate extraction of attachments from emails to streamline processing.
2. **Document Review Platforms**: Enhance review processes by making all attachments readily available.
3. **Legal Document Handling**: Quickly access all attachments for comprehensive case management.

Integration possibilities include connecting with CRM systems or document storage solutions like SharePoint and Azure Blob Storage.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is crucial when dealing with large documents:
- **Resource Management**: Always use the `using` statement to ensure proper disposal of resources.
- **Batch Processing**: If handling multiple documents, consider processing them in batches to reduce memory load.
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Use appropriate data structures for storing and accessing attachment metadata.
