string filePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX";
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath))
{
    // Configuration settings go here.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Minification of HTML Documents

Minifying HTML reduces file size and improves load times, making it a crucial step for web optimization.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory
Start by specifying where your minified files will be saved:

```csharp
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Viewer with Minification Option

Load the document and configure HTML view options to enable minification:

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.Minify = true; // Enable HTML minification
    
    viewer.View(options);  // Render the document with minification
}
```
In this setup:
- `HtmlViewOptions` configures how documents are rendered.
- Setting `options.Minify = true` activates HTML minification.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correctly specified to avoid exceptions.
- Check for any version compatibility issues between GroupDocs and your .NET framework.
