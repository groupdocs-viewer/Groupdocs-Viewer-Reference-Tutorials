        // Set up the viewer with a document path
        using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("Sample.docx"))
        {
            // Configuration and setup code here...
        }
    }
}
```

With your environment set up, it's time to implement text extraction.

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into clear steps to help you understand each feature of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

### Extracting Text from a Document

The main goal here is to extract and display detailed text information like lines, words, and characters. Hereâ€™s how we achieve this:

#### Initialize Viewer Object

Start by initializing the `Viewer` object with your document path.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\Sample.docx"))
{
    // Proceed with setting options and extraction...
}
```

#### Set View Options

Configure the view options to retrieve structured information in a readable format, such as PNG.

```csharp
ViewInfoOptions options = ViewInfoOptions.ForPngView(true);
```

#### Retrieve Structured View Information

Use `GetViewInfo` to obtain detailed page structure data.

```csharp
ViewInfo viewInfo = viewer.GetViewInfo(options);
```

#### Iterate Through Document Pages and Content

Loop through each page, line, word, and character to extract text details:

```csharp
foreach (Page page in viewInfo.Pages)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Page: {page.Number}");
    
    foreach (Line line in page.Lines)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(line);
        
        foreach (Word word in line.Words)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"\t{word}");
            
            foreach (Character character in word.Characters)
                Console.WriteLine($"\t\t{character}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your document path is correct and accessible.
- Handle exceptions that might arise during file reading or processing.
