using GroupDocs.Viewer;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;

string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "RenderedHTML");
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");

if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\Sample.docx"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    // Your configurations will go here
}
```
This setup ensures you're ready to manipulate document rendering with GroupDocs.Viewer.

## Implementation Guide

### Excluding Fonts from HTML Output

In this section, we'll focus on how to exclude specific fonts from your HTML output using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. 

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Ensure that the output directory exists and is correctly set up:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "RenderedHTML");
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");

if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}
```
This step ensures that your rendered files have a designated location.

#### Step 2: Configure HTML View Options
Here's how to configure the viewer to output embedded resource HTML files:
```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\Sample.docx"))
{
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```
The `HtmlViewOptions` object is crucial for specifying how your documents are rendered into HTML.

#### Step 3: Exclude Specific Fonts
To exclude the Arial font, modify the `options` configuration:
```csharp
options.FontsToExclude.Add("Arial");
```
This line tells GroupDocs.Viewer to omit Arial from any fonts it embeds in the output HTML. By specifying `FontsToExclude`, you gain control over how your document's visual styling is preserved across different environments.

#### Step 4: Render the Document
Finally, render your document with these settings:
```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```
By calling `View()`, GroupDocs.Viewer processes your document according to the specified options and outputs it into HTML format without the excluded fonts.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correctly set up.
- Verify that you're using a compatible version of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.
- Double-check font names as they must match exactly, including case sensitivity.

## Practical Applications

### Use Cases:
1. **Consistent Branding**: Exclude unwanted fonts to ensure your brand's typography remains consistent across all platforms.
2. **Web Integration**: Integrate with CMS systems that require specific fonts for web design consistency.
3. **Document Archiving**: Archive documents in HTML format without extraneous fonts, reducing file size.

### Integration Possibilities:
- Leverage GroupDocs.Viewer within .NET applications to create custom document viewing solutions.
- Combine with frameworks like ASP.NET MVC or Blazor for dynamic document rendering on the web.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is crucial when dealing with large documents. Here are some tips:

- **Resource Management**: Be mindful of your application's memory usage, especially with large files.
- **Batch Processing**: If applicable, process documents in batches to avoid overwhelming system resources.
- **Efficient Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed documents.
