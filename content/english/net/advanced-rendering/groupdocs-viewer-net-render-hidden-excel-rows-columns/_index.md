- Integrate rendering functionalities into your C# applications
- Optimize performance when handling large Excel files

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **.NET Development Environment**: Set up a development environment such as Visual Studio.
- **GroupDocs.Viewer Library**: Install GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET (version 25.3.0).
- **Sample Excel File**: Prepare an Excel file with hidden rows and columns to test the implementation.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET

To begin, add the GroupDocs.Viewer library to your project using either of these methods:

### NuGet Package Manager Console

```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Viewer -Version 25.3.0
```

### .NET CLI

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Viewer --version 25.3.0
```

Next, obtain a free trial or temporary license for full access to the library's features at [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/). Initialize and set up GroupDocs.Viewer in your C# application:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Viewer;

// Initialize Viewer object with a path to your Excel document
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("path/to/your/sample.xlsx"))
{
    // Your rendering logic will go here
}
```

This setup prepares you for implementing advanced features like rendering hidden rows and columns.

## Implementation Guide

### Rendering Hidden Rows and Columns

Focus on rendering hidden elements in Excel files using GroupDocs.Viewer. Here's how it works:

#### Initializing the Viewer Object

Create a `Viewer` object with your sample document containing hidden rows or columns.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");

using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XLSX_WITH_HIDDEN_ROW_AND_COLUMN"))
{
    // Additional configurations will be done here
}
```

#### Configuring HtmlViewOptions

Set up `HtmlViewOptions` to render the document with embedded resources.

```csharp
// Define options for HTML rendering with embedded resources
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```

#### Enabling Hidden Rows and Columns Rendering

Configure `SpreadsheetOptions` within `HtmlViewOptions` to enable the rendering of hidden rows and columns.

```csharp
options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderHiddenColumns = true;
options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderHiddenRows = true;
```

This step ensures that all hidden data in your Excel file is visible when rendered as HTML.

#### Rendering the Document

Finally, use the `View` method to render the document with specified options:

```csharp
viewer.View(options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Document Path Issues**: Ensure paths are correctly defined and accessible.
- **Version Compatibility**: Verify that GroupDocs.Viewer version 25.3.0 is compatible with your environment.

## Practical Applications

1. **Financial Reporting**: Display hidden financial data without altering the original spreadsheet for transparency and audit purposes.
2. **Project Management**: Visualize all tasks, including those marked as complete or inactive, to ensure comprehensive project tracking.
3. **Data Analysis**: Uncover insights from hidden rows/columns during extensive data analysis processes.

Integration with other .NET systems can enhance functionalities, such as connecting the rendering process to a web application for dynamic report generation.

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize memory usage by managing document views efficiently and disposing of resources promptly.
- Leverage batch processing when dealing with multiple documents to reduce overhead.

Adhering to best practices in .NET memory management ensures that your applications remain performant even with large Excel files.
