1. **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore the full capabilities of GroupDocs.Viewer.
2. **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for more extensive testing without evaluation limitations.
3. **Purchase**: For long-term use, consider purchasing a commercial license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Here's how you can initialize and set up GroupDocs.Viewer in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Viewer;
using GroupDocs.Viewer.Options;

string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string pageFilePathFormat = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "page_{0}.html");

// Initialize the Viewer object with a sample XLSX file path.
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\Sample.xlsx"))
{
    // Configure HtmlViewOptions to embed resources within each HTML page.
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);

    // Enable rendering of grid lines in the spreadsheet.
    options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderGridLines = true;

    // Render specified pages (1, 2, and 3) from the document to HTML with the configured options.
    viewer.View(options, 1, 2, 3);
}
```
In this setup:
- **Viewer**: Loads your spreadsheet file for viewing.
- **HtmlViewOptions**: Configures how the HTML output should be generated.
- **SpreadsheetOptions.RenderGridLines**: Ensures grid lines are rendered.

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation into clear steps.

### Rendering Grid Lines in Spreadsheets

**Overview:**
Rendering grid lines is essential for maintaining readability and context of spreadsheet data when converted to HTML.

#### Step 1: Initialize Viewer Object
Create a `Viewer` object with your Excel file path. This object will handle loading and rendering your document.

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\Sample.xlsx"))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
**Purpose:** Loads the spreadsheet for viewing.

#### Step 2: Configure HtmlViewOptions
Set up `HtmlViewOptions` to specify how HTML resources should be embedded within each page of your output.

```csharp
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```
**Key Parameter:**
- **pageFilePathFormat**: Defines the naming pattern for generated HTML pages, ensuring they are stored in your specified directory.

#### Step 3: Enable Grid Line Rendering
Activate grid line rendering using `SpreadsheetOptions.RenderGridLines`.

```csharp
options.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderGridLines = true;
```
**Why This Matters:** Preserves the visual structure of your spreadsheet when viewed as HTML.

#### Step 4: Render Pages to HTML
Specify which pages to render and execute the rendering process with `viewer.View`.

```csharp
viewer.View(options, 1, 2, 3);
```
**Parameters Explained:**
- **options**: Contains configurations for rendering.
- **Pages (1, 2, 3)**: Specifies which document pages to convert.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the output directory path is correctly set and accessible.
- Verify that your Excel file path is correct to avoid loading errors.
- Check for any missing dependencies or incorrect versions of GroupDocs.Viewer.

3. **Reporting Tools**: Use in tools where spreadsheet data needs to be presented accurately on the web.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is crucial for seamless operation:
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of objects promptly.
- Limit the number of pages rendered at once if dealing with large documents.
- Monitor resource usage and adjust configurations as needed for optimal performance.
