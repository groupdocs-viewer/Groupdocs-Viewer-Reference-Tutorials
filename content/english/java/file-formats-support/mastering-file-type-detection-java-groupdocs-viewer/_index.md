      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Environment Setup

Ensure your development environment is ready to use GroupDocs.Viewer. You can obtain a free trial license or purchase one from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy). Follow the instructions on their website for license acquisition.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java

To begin using GroupDocs.Viewer in your project, integrate it via Maven as shown above. Here's a quick rundown of setting up and initializing the library:

1. **Add the Repository and Dependency**: Include the necessary repository and dependency entries in your `pom.xml`.
2. **Acquire a License**: Visit [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) to get a free trial or purchase a license. Follow their guidelines for applying the license.
3. **Initialize GroupDocs.Viewer**:
   ```java
   import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
   
   Viewer viewer = new Viewer("path/to/your/document");
   // Perform operations with the viewer...
   ```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's dive into implementing file type determination using GroupDocs.Viewer.

### Determine FileType from Extension

This feature allows you to identify a file type based on its extension, useful for handling user-uploaded files where content type isn't immediately known.

#### Overview
Use the `FileType.fromExtension()` method to determine the file type from an extension like `.docx` or `.pdf`.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Define the File Extension**:
   ```java
   import com.groupdocs.viewer.FileType;
   
   public class FileTypeFromExtension {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String extension = ".docx"; // Specify the file extension
           
           // Determine the file type from the given extension
           FileType fileType = FileType.fromExtension(extension);
           
           System.out.println("File Type: " + fileType.getName());
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Explanation**:
   - `FileType.fromExtension(String extension)`: This method takes a string representing the file extension and returns a `FileType` object.
   - The `getName()` method on the `FileType` object provides a human-readable name of the determined file type.

### Determine FileType from Media-Type

Identifying file types using media-types (MIME types) is beneficial when dealing with web-based applications where files are identified by their MIME types.

#### Overview
Use the `FileType.fromMediaType()` method to determine the file type based on a given media-type string like `application/pdf`.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Define the Media-Type**:
   ```java
   public class FileTypeFromMediaType {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String mediaType = "application/pdf"; // Specify the MIME type
           
           // Determine the file type from the given media-type
           FileType fileType = FileType.fromMediaType(mediaType);
           
           System.out.println("File Type: " + fileType.getName());
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Explanation**:
   - `FileType.fromMediaType(String mediaType)`: This method accepts a MIME type string and returns a corresponding `FileType` object.
   - The result provides insights into the file format, useful for processing or rendering content.

### Determine FileType from Stream

For scenarios where you need to identify file types by reading directly from an input stream (e.g., files uploaded through a web form), GroupDocs.Viewer offers a straightforward solution.

#### Overview
The `FileType.fromStream()` method allows you to determine the file type by inspecting the contents of an InputStream.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Open an InputStream**:
   ```java
   import com.groupdocs.viewer.FileType;
   import java.io.FileInputStream;
   import java.io.IOException;
   import java.io.InputStream;
   
   public class FileTypeFromStream {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
           String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX"; // Path to the document
           
           try (InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(filePath)) {
               // Determine the file type from the input stream
               FileType fileType = FileType.fromStream(inputStream);
               
               System.out.println("File Type: " + fileType.getName());
           }
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Explanation**:
   - `FileType.fromStream(InputStream inputStream)`: This method reads the content of an InputStream to determine the file type.
   - It's especially useful for processing files without relying on extensions or MIME types.

## Practical Applications

Understanding how to determine file types can be applied in various real-world scenarios:
1. **Web Application File Uploads**: Automatically categorize and process uploaded files based on their determined types.
2. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Ensure the correct rendering of documents by identifying their formats before processing.
3. **Data Migration Tools**: Validate and transform data during migration tasks by recognizing file types from streams or extensions.

## Performance Considerations

When integrating GroupDocs.Viewer for file type determination, consider these performance tips:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Use try-with-resources to manage InputStreams efficiently and prevent memory leaks.
- **Java Memory Management**: Ensure your application handles large files gracefully, possibly by processing them in chunks if necessary.

## Conclusion

You've now mastered the art of determining file types using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java. By leveraging extensions, media-types, and streams, you can enhance your applications' flexibility and robustness. 

**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with different file types to see how GroupDocs.Viewer handles them.
