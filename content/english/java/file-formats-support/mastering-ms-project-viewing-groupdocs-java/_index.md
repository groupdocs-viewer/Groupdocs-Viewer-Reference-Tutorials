### Basic Initialization

Once your project is set up with GroupDocs.Viewer as a dependency, initialize it by creating an instance of `Viewer` and passing the path to your MS Project file.

## Implementation Guide

### Retrieve View Info for MS Project Document

This feature allows you to extract detailed information about your MS Project documents using GroupDocs.Viewer.

#### Step 1: Define Document Path

Specify the location of your MS Project file:

```java
String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MPP";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize ViewInfoOptions

Set up `ViewInfoOptions` for HTML view information retrieval:

```java
ViewInfoOptions viewInfoOptions = ViewInfoOptions.forHtmlView();
```

#### Step 3: Retrieve and Output Project Details

Create a `Viewer` instance, retrieve project details, and print them out:

```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath)) {
    ProjectManagementViewInfo info = (ProjectManagementViewInfo) viewer.getViewInfo(viewInfoOptions);

    System.out.println("Document type: " + info.getFileType());
    System.out.println("Pages count: " + info.getPages().size());
    System.out.println("Project start date: " + info.getStartDate());
    System.out.println("Project end date: " + info.getEndDate());
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- `getViewInfo(viewInfoOptions)`: Retrieves view information based on specified options.
- The retrieved `info` object contains properties like file type, page count, and project dates.

### Setup for GroupDocs.Viewer Configuration

This section details configuring load options for secure document access.

#### Step 1: Configure Load Options

For password-protected MS Project files, set up the `LoadOptions`:

```java
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.setPassword("your_password_if_needed");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Viewer with Load Options

Pass the configured `loadOptions` when creating a `Viewer` instance:

```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath, loadOptions)) {
    // Viewer is now ready for use with the specified document and options.
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `LoadOptions` class allows specifying additional parameters like passwords.

## Practical Applications

1. **Project Management Dashboards**: Integrate MS Project data into dashboards for real-time project tracking.
2. **Automated Reporting**: Generate detailed reports by extracting key information from multiple projects.
3. **Integration with CRM Systems**: Use extracted project details to enhance customer relationship management strategies.
