With your environment set up, let's move on to implementing the feature that allows us to adjust JPG image quality in PDFs.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Adjust Quality of JPG Images in PDF

This feature focuses on modifying the resolution and quality of JPG images when converting documents like presentations into PDF format using GroupDocs.Viewer.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory Path

Start by resolving the output directory where your converted PDF will be saved:

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class FeatureResolveOutputDirectoryPath {
    public static Path getOutputDirectoryPath(String subdirectory) {
        String directory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "AdjustQualityOfJpgImages", subdirectory).toString();
        
        try {
            return Paths.get(directory);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Failed to create output directory.", e);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure PdfViewOptions

Create an instance of `PdfViewOptions` and specify the desired quality for JPG images:

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.PdfViewOptions;

public class FeatureAdjustQualityOfJpgImages {
    public static void run() {
        Path outputDirectory = FeatureResolveOutputDirectoryPath.getOutputDirectoryPath("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
        Path filePath = outputDirectory.resolve("output.pdf");

        PdfViewOptions viewOptions = new PdfViewOptions(filePath);
        
        // Set desired JPG quality (0-100 scale)
        byte quality = 10;
        viewOptions.setJpgQuality(quality);

        try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/source.pptx")) {
            viewer.view(viewOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `setJpgQuality(byte quality)`: Adjusts the quality of JPG images in the output PDF. Lower values decrease file size but also reduce image clarity.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your input document path is correct.
- Verify that the output directory exists or handle exceptions if it doesn't.
- Check for any version conflicts with dependencies.

## Practical Applications

1. **Document Archiving:** Adjusting image quality helps in reducing storage space while maintaining readability.
2. **Web Publishing:** Optimize images for faster loading times without compromising on visual quality.
3. **Email Attachments:** Compress PDFs to meet email size limits by lowering JPG quality.

Integration possibilities include automated document conversion systems and cloud-based document management solutions.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimization Tips:** Adjust image quality based on the intended use-case, such as high quality for print but lower for web.
- **Resource Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage when processing large documents; consider batch processing if necessary.
- **Best Practices:** Regularly update GroupDocs.Viewer to leverage performance improvements and new features.
