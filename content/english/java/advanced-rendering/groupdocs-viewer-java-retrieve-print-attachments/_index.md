## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
*   **GroupDocs.Viewer for Java:** Download the latest version.
*   **Development Environment:** An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** Familiarity with Java programming and Maven.

## Setup and Configuration

First, integrate GroupDocs.Viewer for Java into your project. If you are using Maven, add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>

## Retrieve and Print Attachments: Step-by-Step

Follow these steps to retrieve and print attachments from a document.

### Step 1: Initialize the Viewer Object

The first step is to create an instance of the `Viewer` class, passing the path to your document as a parameter.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.results.Attachment;
import java.util.List;

// Path to the document with attachments
String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS.msg";

try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath)) {
    // Your code to retrieve attachments will go here
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
**Explanation:** The `Viewer` object is initialized within a `try-with-resources` block to ensure proper resource management. Replace `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/...` with the actual path to your file.

### Step 2: Get the List of Attachments

Use the `getAttachments()` method of the `Viewer` object to fetch all attachments associated with the document.

```java
// Inside the try block from Step 1
List<Attachment> attachments = viewer.getAttachments();
```
**Explanation:** This method returns a `List` of `Attachment` objects, where each object contains information about an individual attached file.

### Step 3: Iterate and Print Attachment Details

Loop through the retrieved list of attachments to access and display their properties, such as the file name and size.

```java
// Inside the try block, after getting attachments
System.out.println("Attachments:");
for (Attachment attachment : attachments) {
    System.out.println(attachment);
}
```
**Explanation:** This loop prints the details of each attachment to the console, which is useful for debugging and confirming that the attachments were retrieved correctly.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

-   **FileNotFoundException:** Double-check that the `documentPath` is correct and the application has read permissions.
-   **Network Access:** If loading documents from a URL, ensure your application has the necessary network and firewall permissions.
-   **Corrupt Documents:** Handle potential exceptions if a document is corrupt or in an unsupported format.

## Conclusion

You have successfully learned how to use GroupDocs.Viewer for Java to retrieve and print document attachments.
