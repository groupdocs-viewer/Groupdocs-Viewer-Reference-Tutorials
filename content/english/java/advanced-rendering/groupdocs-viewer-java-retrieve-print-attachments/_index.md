Let's start by covering the prerequisites needed before we begin.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies

Make sure your setup includes:
- **GroupDocs.Viewer for Java**: Version 25.2 or later
- A Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher

### Environment Setup Requirements

Prepare your development environment to run Java applications, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Knowledge Prerequisites

A basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with Maven for dependency management is recommended.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java

To implement the functionality to retrieve and print document attachments, let's set up GroupDocs.Viewer in your project. If you're using Maven, add the following configuration to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition

Start with a free trial to explore GroupDocs.Viewer's capabilities. For continued use, consider acquiring a temporary license for testing or purchasing a full license.

Once your environment is ready and the library is added to your project, let's move on to implementing the feature.

## Implementation Guide

This section will guide you through retrieving and printing attachments from documents using GroupDocs.Viewer Java. 

### Overview of Retrieving Attachments

Retrieving document attachments involves accessing files embedded within formats like MSG or EML. This functionality is crucial for applications dealing with email clients or archival systems.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Viewer Object

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import java.util.List;

// Define the path to your document containing attachments
String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS";

try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath)) {
    // Code for retrieving and printing attachments will go here
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

**Explanation**: This code snippet initializes a `Viewer` object with the specified document path. The `try-with-resources` statement ensures that the viewer is closed properly after use.

#### Step 2: Retrieve Attachments

```java
// Retrieve all attachments from the specified document
List<Attachment> attachments = viewer.getAttachments();
```

**Explanation**: Here, we call the `getAttachments()` method to fetch a list of attachments. This list contains `Attachment` objects, each representing an individual attachment.

#### Step 3: Print Attachment Details

```java
// Iterate through each attachment and print its details
for (Attachment attachment : attachments) {
    System.out.println(attachment);
}
```

**Explanation**: We loop through the list of attachments, printing out their details. This is helpful for verifying that all attachments are retrieved correctly.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your document path is correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify network permissions if accessing documents over a network.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to improve application robustness.

## Practical Applications

Integrating GroupDocs.Viewer Java into your applications offers numerous possibilities:

1. **Email Clients**: Automatically retrieve attachments from emails for preview or further processing.
2. **Document Management Systems**: Enhance user experience by allowing access to embedded files within documents.
3. **Archival Solutions**: Simplify the process of extracting and archiving document attachments.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large sets of documents, consider these tips:
- **Memory Management**: Optimize Java memory settings for better performance.
- **Batch Processing**: Process documents in batches to reduce load times.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous methods where possible to keep your application responsive.
