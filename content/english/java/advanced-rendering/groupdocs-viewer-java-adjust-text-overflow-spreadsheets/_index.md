Dealing with overflowing text in spreadsheet cells is a common challenge when converting Excel files to HTML. **GroupDocs.Viewer for Java** provides a simple and effective solution to manage and hide this overflow, ensuring your spreadsheets are displayed cleanly and professionally.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of hiding text that overflows from spreadsheet cells using GroupDocs.Viewer in your Java applications. You will learn how to:
- Set up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java in your project.
- Configure `HtmlViewOptions` to control text overflow in Excel sheets.
- Apply this feature in practical scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
*   **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or another Java IDE.
*   **Maven:** For managing project dependencies.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** A solid understanding of Java programming.

## Setup and Configuration

First, you need to add the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java dependency to your project.

### Maven Configuration

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Licensing

GroupDocs.Viewer for Java requires a license for full functionality. You can get a [free temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for evaluation or purchase a [full license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

## Adjust Text Overflow in Spreadsheets

Follow these steps to hide overflowing text when rendering an Excel spreadsheet to HTML.

### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

Specify the directory where the rendered HTML files will be saved and the format for the output file names.

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// Define the output directory
Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
// Define the format for the output file path
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` with your desired path.

### Step 2: Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of `HtmlViewOptions` and set the `TextOverflowMode` for spreadsheets to `HIDE_TEXT`.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.TextOverflowMode;

// Create HTML view options for embedded resources
HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
// Set the text overflow mode to hide overflowing text
viewOptions.getSpreadsheetOptions().setTextOverflowMode(TextOverflowMode.HIDE_TEXT);
```
**Explanation:** By setting the `TextOverflowMode` to `HIDE_TEXT`, any content that exceeds the boundaries of a cell will be hidden in the HTML output, preventing visual clutter.

### Step 3: Load and Render the Document

Initialize the `Viewer` object with your Excel file and call the `view()` method with the configured options.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;

// Path to your Excel file with overflowing text
String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_WITH_OVERFLOW.xlsx";

try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath)) {
    // Render the document with the specified options
    viewer.view(viewOptions);
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("An error occurred during rendering: " + e.getMessage());
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
**Troubleshooting:** Ensure that the file paths are correct and that your application has write permissions to the output directory.

## Practical Applications

This feature is invaluable in various scenarios:
*   **Web Portals:** Display financial reports and data tables where clarity and a clean layout are crucial.
*   **Data Analytics Platforms:** Present large datasets without overwhelming users with overflowing text.
*   **Customer Dashboards:** Offer insights through spreadsheets while maintaining a neat and professional visual presentation.

## Performance Considerations

-   **Memory Management:** Efficiently manage memory, especially when processing large Excel files, by using `try-with-resources`.
-   **Resource Usage:** Use embedded resources wisely to balance load times and rendering quality.
-   **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently rendered documents to reduce redundant processing.
