You will learn how to:
- Configure GroupDocs.Viewer in your Java project.
- Implement responsive HTML rendering with just a few lines of code.
- Explore practical applications and integration possibilities.
- Optimize performance for efficient resource management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
*   **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or another Java IDE.
*   **Maven:** For dependency management.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** A good understanding of Java programming.

## Setup and Configuration

First, you need to add the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java dependency to your project.

### Maven Configuration

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Licensing

GroupDocs.Viewer for Java requires a license for full functionality. You can get a [free temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for evaluation or purchase a [full license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

## Render a Document to Responsive HTML

Follow these steps to convert a document into a responsive HTML page.

### Step 1: Import Required Classes

Start by importing the necessary classes from the GroupDocs.Viewer library.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;
```

### Step 2: Define Document and Output Paths

Set up the paths for your input document and the output directory.

```java
// Path to your input document
String inputDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE.docx";
// Directory to save the output HTML
String outputDirectoryPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```
**Note:** Replace the placeholder paths with the actual paths in your project.

### Step 3: Initialize the Viewer Object

Create a `Viewer` object to process the document. Using a `try-with-resources` statement ensures that resources are managed efficiently.

```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(inputDocumentPath)) {
    // Configuration for rendering will go here
}
```

### Step 4: Configure HTML View Options

Configure the HTML view settings and enable responsive rendering.

```java
// Define the format for the output file path
String pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectoryPath + "/page_{0}.html";
// Create HTML view options for embedded resources
HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
// Enable responsive rendering
viewOptions.setRenderResponsive(true);
```

### Step 5: Render the Document

Execute the rendering process to generate the responsive HTML.

```java
// Inside the try block
viewer.view(viewOptions);
```
This will create HTML pages that automatically adjust their layout to fit different screen sizes.

### Troubleshooting

-   **Output Not Responsive:** Ensure that `setRenderResponsive(true)` is called on your `HtmlViewOptions` object.
-   **File Not Found:** Verify that the input and output paths are correct and that the directories exist.

## Practical Applications

Responsive HTML rendering with GroupDocs.Viewer can be used in various scenarios:
*   **Online Document Portals:** Allow users to view uploaded documents seamlessly on any device.
*   **E-commerce:** Display product manuals and specification sheets in a responsive format.
*   **Internal Knowledge Bases:** Convert reports and presentations into an accessible format for all employees.

## Performance Considerations

-   **Embedded Resources:** Using embedded resources can lead to faster page loads for the end-user.
-   **Resource Management:** Always close the `Viewer` object promptly to free up memory. The `try-with-resources` statement is the recommended way to do this.
-   **Stay Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of GroupDocs.Viewer to benefit from performance improvements.
