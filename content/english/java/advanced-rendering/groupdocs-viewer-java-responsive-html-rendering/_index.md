```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's dive into implementing responsive HTML rendering using GroupDocs.Viewer.

### Render Document to Responsive HTML

This feature allows you to convert documents into responsive HTML pages. Here are the implementation steps:

#### Step 1: Import Required Classes
Start by importing necessary classes from the GroupDocs library:
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;
```

#### Step 2: Define Document Paths
Set up your input and output paths for document rendering:
```java
String inputDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX";
String outputDirectoryPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```
*Replace these placeholders with actual paths in your project.*

#### Step 3: Initialize Viewer Object
Create a `Viewer` object to handle the file processing. Use a try-with-resources statement for efficient resource management:
```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(inputDocumentPath)) {
    // Proceed with rendering options setup
}
```

#### Step 4: Configure HTML View Options
Configure your HTML view settings, including enabling responsive rendering:
```java
String pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectoryPath + "/page_{0}.html";
HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
viewOptions.setRenderResponsive(true); // Enable responsive rendering
```

#### Step 5: Render the Document
Execute the document rendering process:
```java
viewer.view(viewOptions);
```
*This will generate HTML pages that adapt to various screen sizes.*

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: If your output isn't responsive, ensure `setRenderResponsive(true)` is called.
- **Missing Files**: Verify paths are correct and directories exist.

## Practical Applications

Responsive HTML rendering with GroupDocs.Viewer opens up a plethora of use cases:
1. **Online Document Portals**: Display user-uploaded documents in web applications seamlessly across devices.
