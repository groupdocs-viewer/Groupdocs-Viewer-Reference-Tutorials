## Implementation Guide
### Get Document View Information
Retrieve comprehensive view-specific details like page counts and available view options from your document using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java.

#### Overview
The goal is to obtain detailed information about a document's views.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Initialize the Viewer**
Set up the `Viewer` class with the path to your document:

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.ViewInfoOptions;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.results.ViewInfo;

public class FeatureGetViewInfo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify the path to your input document.
        String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF";
        
        // Initialize ViewInfoOptions for HTML view.
        ViewInfoOptions viewInfoOptions = ViewInfoOptions.forHtmlView();

        try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath)) {
            // Retrieve view information about the document using the specified options.
            ViewInfo info = viewer.getViewInfo(viewInfoOptions);
            
            // The info object now contains details like page count and available views.
        }
    }
}
```

**2. Understanding Parameters and Methods**
- **`ViewInfoOptions.forHtmlView()`:** Configures the view to retrieve HTML-specific information.
- **`viewer.getViewInfo(viewInfoOptions)`:** Fetches detailed view information based on provided options.

#### Key Configuration Options
