## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
*   **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or another Java IDE.
*   **Maven:** For managing project dependencies.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** A solid understanding of Java programming.

## Setup and Configuration

First, you need to add the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java dependency to your project.

### Maven Configuration

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Licensing

GroupDocs.Viewer for Java requires a license for full functionality. You can get a [free temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for evaluation or purchase a [full license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

## Get Document View Information

You can retrieve comprehensive, view-specific details such as page counts and available view options from your documents.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Initialize the Viewer and ViewInfoOptions

Set up the `Viewer` class with the path to your document and create `ViewInfoOptions` to specify the type of view information you want to retrieve.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.ViewInfoOptions;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.results.ViewInfo;

public class GetDocumentViewInfo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify the path to your input document
        String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE.pdf";
        
        // Create ViewInfoOptions for an HTML view
        ViewInfoOptions viewInfoOptions = ViewInfoOptions.forHtmlView();

        try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath)) {
            // Retrieve view information from the document
            ViewInfo info = viewer.getViewInfo(viewInfoOptions);
            
            // The 'info' object now contains details like page count
            System.out.println("Document has " + info.getPages().size() + " pages.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. Understanding the Code

-   **`ViewInfoOptions.forHtmlView()`:** This method configures the options to retrieve information relevant to an HTML-based view. You can also use `forPdfView()` or `forJpgView()`/`forPngView()` for other formats.
-   **`viewer.getViewInfo(viewInfoOptions)`:** This method fetches the detailed view information based on the provided options. The returned `ViewInfo` object contains properties like the list of pages.

### Troubleshooting

-   **File Not Found:** Ensure the document path is correct and the file exists.
-   **Dependency Issues:** Verify that your Maven dependencies are correctly configured in your `pom.xml`.

## Practical Applications

This feature is useful in various scenarios:
*   **Document Management Systems:** Automatically generate and display metadata for stored documents.
*   **Document Preview:** Offer users a preview of a document without rendering its entire content.
*   **Analytics and Reporting:** Gather insights into document structure and usage patterns.

## Performance Considerations

-   **Resource Management:** Use a `try-with-resources` statement to ensure the `Viewer` instance is properly closed, especially when dealing with large documents or batch processing.
-   **Caching:** For frequently accessed documents, consider caching the `ViewInfo` results to improve performance.

## Conclusion

You have now learned how to retrieve view information from documents using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java. This feature is invaluable for applications that require detailed insights into document structure and viewing capabilities. As a next step, explore other features of GroupDocs.Viewer, such as advanced rendering options and security settings.
