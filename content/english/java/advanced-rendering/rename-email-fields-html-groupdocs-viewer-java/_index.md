## Implementation Guide

### Renaming Email Fields
In this section, you’ll learn how to customize email field names when rendering an email message to HTML format.

#### Overview
The primary goal is to map default email fields like "From," "To," and "Subject" to custom names such as "Sender," "Receiver," and "Topic."

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Set Up the Output Directory Path
```java
import java.nio.file.Path;

Path outputDirectory = Utils.getOutputDirectoryPath("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
```
**Explanation**: Replace `"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"` with your desired path where HTML files will be saved.

##### 2. Define Page File Path Format
```java
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");
```
**Explanation**: This format determines how each rendered page’s file name is structured, with `{0}` being replaced by the page number.

##### 3. Create a Mapping of Email Fields to New Names
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.Field;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

Map<Field, String> fieldTextMap = new HashMap<>();
fieldTextMap.put(Field.FROM, "Sender");
fieldTextMap.put(Field.TO, "Receiver");
fieldTextMap.put(Field.SENT, "Date");
fieldTextMap.put(Field.SUBJECT, "Topic");
```
**Explanation**: Customize the email metadata by mapping existing fields to your preferred names.

##### 4. Configure HTML View Options
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;

HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
viewOptions.getEmailOptions().setFieldTextMap(fieldTextMap);
```
**Explanation**: The `forEmbeddedResources` method ensures all necessary resources are embedded within the HTML file, while `setFieldTextMap` applies your custom field mappings.

##### 5. Render the Email to HTML
```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG")) {
    viewer.view(viewOptions);
}
```
**Explanation**: Adjust `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG"` with the path to your MSG file. This step renders the email using specified options.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that the output directory is writable.
- Verify that the input MSG file exists and is accessible.
- Check for compatibility issues if you're using a different version of GroupDocs.Viewer.

## Practical Applications
This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where:
1. **Custom Email Reports**: Tailoring email headers to match corporate terminology enhances readability.
2. **Email Archiving Systems**: Customizing metadata improves search and retrieval efficiency.
3. **Customer Support Platforms**: Personalized email headers aid in better client communication.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java:
- Use efficient memory management techniques, such as proper object disposal with try-with-resources.
- Profile your application to identify bottlenecks related to document rendering and handle them appropriately.
