In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
- Set up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java in your project.
- Configure the library to limit the number of items rendered from Outlook files.
- Explore practical applications and performance considerations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
*   **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or another Java IDE.
*   **Maven:** For managing project dependencies.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** A solid understanding of Java programming.

## Setup and Configuration

First, you need to add the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java dependency to your project.

### Maven Configuration

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Licensing

GroupDocs.Viewer for Java requires a license for full functionality. You can get a [free temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for evaluation or purchase a [full license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

## Limit Items Rendered from Outlook Files

This section details how to restrict the number of items rendered from Outlook data files.

### Step 1: Set Up Output Directory and File Path Format

Define the directory where the rendered HTML files will be saved and the format for the output file names.

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// Define the output directory
Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
// Define the format for the output file path
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` with your desired path.

### Step 2: Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of `HtmlViewOptions` and set the Outlook-specific options to limit the number of items to render.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;

// Create HTML view options for embedded resources
HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
// Set the maximum number of items to render per folder
viewOptions.getOutlookOptions().setMaxItemsInFolder(3);
```
**Explanation:** This configuration will render only the first three items in each folder of the Outlook data file. You can adjust this number to fit your needs.

### Step 3: Load and Render the Document

Initialize the `Viewer` object with your Outlook data file and call the `view()` method with the configured options.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;

// Path to your Outlook data file (PST or OST)
String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE.ost";

try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath)) {
    // Render the document with the specified options
    viewer.view(viewOptions);
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("An error occurred during rendering: " + e.getMessage());
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
**Troubleshooting:** Ensure that the file paths are correct and that your application has the necessary permissions to avoid a `FileNotFoundException`.

## Practical Applications

Limiting item rendering is useful in various scenarios:
*   **Email Archiving:** Archive only a specific number of recent emails from large mailboxes.
*   **Data Migration:** Optimize performance by rendering only essential items during data migration.
*   **Custom Reporting:** Generate reports by selectively rendering required email content.

## Performance Considerations

-   **Memory Usage:** Limiting the number of items per folder significantly reduces memory consumption.
-   **Resource Management:** Use a `try-with-resources` statement to ensure the `Viewer` object is properly closed.
-   **Profiling:** Profile your application to identify any bottlenecks when handling large files.
