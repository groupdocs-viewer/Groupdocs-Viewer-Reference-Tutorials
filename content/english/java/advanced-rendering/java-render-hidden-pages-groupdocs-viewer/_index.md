## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java

To get started, set up GroupDocs.Viewer in your project. Here's how:

### Maven Setup

Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file to include GroupDocs.Viewer as a dependency:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>

import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
```

Initialize the Viewer object to start using GroupDocs.Viewer functionalities.

## Implementation Guide

### Rendering Hidden Pages

This feature allows you to render hidden pages in your documents, ensuring complete visibility of all content. Let's break down the steps:

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

Set up where your rendered HTML files will be saved:

```java
Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");
```

- **`outputDirectory`**: The directory path to store the output files.
- **`pageFilePathFormat`**: Format for naming each page's file, using placeholders like `{0}`.

#### Step 2: Configure HtmlViewOptions

Create an instance of `HtmlViewOptions`, specifying that resources should be embedded:

```java
HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
viewOptions.setRenderHiddenPages(true); // Enable rendering of hidden pages
```

- **`forEmbeddedResources`**: Ensures all necessary resources are included within the HTML files.
- **`setRenderHiddenPages(true)`**: Activates the rendering of hidden slides or sections.

#### Step 3: Render Document

Use the Viewer object to render your document with the specified options:

```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PPTX_HIDDEN_PAGE")) {
    viewer.view(viewOptions);
}
```

- **`Viewer`**: Manages the loading and rendering of documents.
- **`view(viewOptions)`**: Executes the rendering process based on the provided options.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Ensure your document path is correct and that you have write permissions for the output directory to avoid common issues.

## Practical Applications

1. **Corporate Presentations**: Automatically include all slides, including those marked as hidden, ensuring complete content delivery during presentations.
2. **Document Archiving**: Archive every piece of information in legal documents by rendering all sections.
3. **Educational Materials**: Provide students with full access to educational materials, including practice questions or additional notes typically hidden.
4. **Interactive Reports**: Enable users to explore every aspect of reports without missing out on supplementary data.
5. **Software Documentation**: Ensure comprehensive documentation by exposing optional configuration settings.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Viewer:
- **Resource Management**: Monitor memory usage and adjust JVM settings as needed.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute rendering tasks across multiple instances if handling large volumes of documents.
- **Efficient File Handling**: Use efficient file I/O operations to minimize latency.
