This tutorial will guide you through using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java to render CAD drawings effectively:
- Setting up the necessary environment and libraries
- Configuring rendering options for CAD files
- Implementing the rendering of all layouts within a CAD file

Let's begin with the prerequisites needed before starting.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following in place:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
You'll need GroupDocs.Viewer for Java. Ensure your project includes version 25.2 or later.
- **Maven Dependency Setup**:
  Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Environment Setup Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed on your system.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and running the code.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming concepts
- Familiarity with Maven for dependency management

With these prerequisites in place, we can proceed to set up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java
To start using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java, follow the installation steps below:

### Installing via Maven
Add the repository and dependency details in your `pom.xml` as shown earlier. This allows Maven to handle downloading and setting up the necessary libraries.

### License Acquisition Steps
GroupDocs offers several ways to obtain a license:
- **Free Trial**: Download from [GroupDocs Free Trial](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/).
- **Temporary License**: Obtain for testing purposes at [Temporary License Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: For ongoing use, purchase a license on the [Buy GroupDocs page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
After setting up your Maven dependencies, initialize the Viewer class to start rendering CAD files. Here's how:

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;

public class CadRendering {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify input CAD file path
        String filePath = "path/to/your/sample.dwg";

        // Initialize viewer with the input file
        try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath)) {
            HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources("output/page_{0}.html");
            viewer.view(viewOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

This code sets up a basic rendering of CAD files using GroupDocs.Viewer.

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's implement the feature to render all layouts from a CAD file.

### Rendering All Layouts in CAD Files
To configure the rendering options for viewing all layouts, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format
Start by setting up paths where your rendered HTML files will be saved. This helps in organizing outputs efficiently.

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;

// Define the output directory path
Path outputDirectory = Path.of("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
// Create a file path format for each page of the CAD drawing
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");
```

#### Step 2: Configure HTML View Options
Enable embedded resources and render all layouts in the CAD file using specific GroupDocs.Viewer options.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;

// Configure HTML view options to use embedded resources
HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```

#### Step 3: Enable Layout Rendering
Set the `RenderLayouts` option to true, ensuring all layouts are rendered.

```java
viewOptions.getCadOptions().setRenderLayouts(true);
```

#### Step 4: Render Document Using Viewer
Finally, use the Viewer class to render your CAD file with the configured options.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;

try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("path/to/sample.dwg")) {
    // Render the document using configured view options
    viewer.view(viewOptions);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure your `pom.xml` is correctly configured and Maven dependencies are up to date.
- **File Path Errors**: Verify that input CAD file paths and output directory paths are correctly specified.

## Practical Applications
Rendering all layouts from a CAD drawing has several real-world applications:
1. **Architectural Presentations**: Enable architects to showcase different design perspectives within a single document.
2. **Engineering Documentation**: Facilitates easier sharing of complex engineering designs with multiple stakeholders.
3. **Educational Resources**: Allows educators to present detailed diagrams and plans in digital classrooms.

Integrating GroupDocs.Viewer can enhance collaboration across various platforms, including web applications or document management systems.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance when rendering CAD files is crucial:
- **Memory Management**: Use efficient data structures and manage Java memory by tuning JVM options.
- **Resource Usage**: Ensure your server has sufficient resources to handle large file sizes and multiple concurrent users.
- **Best Practices**: Regularly update GroupDocs.Viewer libraries for improvements and bug fixes.

## Conclusion
