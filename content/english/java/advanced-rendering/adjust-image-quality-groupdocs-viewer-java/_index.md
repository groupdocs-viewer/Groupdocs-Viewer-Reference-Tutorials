You will learn how to:
- Set up and configure GroupDocs.Viewer for Java.
- Adjust image quality within a source PDF document step-by-step.
- Apply best practices for performance optimization during rendering.
- Explore practical applications of this feature.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need:
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
*   **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or another Java IDE.
*   **Maven:** For managing project dependencies.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** A solid understanding of Java programming.

## Setup and Configuration

First, you need to add the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java dependency to your project.

### Maven Configuration

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Licensing

GroupDocs.Viewer for Java requires a license for full functionality. You can get a [free temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for evaluation or purchase a [full license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

## Optimize Image Quality in PDFs

Follow these steps to adjust the image quality when rendering a PDF to HTML.

### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path Format

Specify the directory where the rendered HTML files will be saved and the format for the output file names.

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// Define the output directory
Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
// Define the format for the output file path
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");
```
**Note:** Replace `YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` with your desired path.

### Step 2: Configure HTML View Options

Create an instance of `HtmlViewOptions` and set the desired image quality level.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.ImageQuality;

// Create HTML view options for embedded resources
HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
// Set the image quality to medium
viewOptions.getPdfOptions().setImageQuality(ImageQuality.MEDIUM);
```
**Explanation:** The `ImageQuality` enum allows you to choose between `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, and `HIGH` quality. `MEDIUM` provides a good balance between file size and visual clarity.

### Step 3: Load and Render the Document

Initialize the `Viewer` object with your PDF file and call the `view()` method with the configured options.

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;

// Path to your PDF file
String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE.pdf";

try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath)) {
    // Render the document with the specified image quality
    viewer.view(viewOptions);
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("An error occurred during rendering: " + e.getMessage());
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
**Troubleshooting:** Ensure that the file paths are correct and that your application has write permissions to the output directory.

## Practical Applications

This feature is useful in various scenarios:
*   **Document Sharing Platforms:** Optimize PDFs for fast online viewing without significant quality loss.
*   **Archiving Systems:** Reduce storage costs by balancing file size and image clarity for long-term storage.
*   **E-Learning Materials:** Enhance engagement with high-quality visuals in educational content while keeping file sizes manageable.

## Performance Considerations

-   **Resource Management:** Use a `try-with-resources` statement to ensure the `Viewer` object is properly closed.
-   **Image Quality:** Higher image quality settings will increase rendering time and resource consumption. Choose the lowest acceptable quality for your use case.
-   **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed documents to improve performance.

## Conclusion

You have now learned how to optimize PDF image quality using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java. This allows you to customize your document presentations to meet your specific needs, balancing visual quality with file size. As a next step, explore other advanced features of the library to further enhance your document management workflows.
