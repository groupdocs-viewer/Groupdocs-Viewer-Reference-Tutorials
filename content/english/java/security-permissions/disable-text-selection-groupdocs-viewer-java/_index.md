# How to Implement Disable Text Selection in PDF Rendering with GroupDocs.Viewer Java
## Introduction
Do you need a secure way to display PDFs on the web without allowing text selection? This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to disable text selection using the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library. By converting text into images, your content remains secure and uneditable when displayed online.
**What You'll Learn:**
- Configuring GroupDocs.Viewer to render PDFs with disabled text selection
- Setting up your environment with GroupDocs.Viewer
- Key code implementation details for this feature
- Practical applications of rendering PDFs with non-selectable text

Let's explore the prerequisites before we dive into the setup process!
## Prerequisites
### Required Libraries and Dependencies
To follow along, ensure you have:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Maven for managing dependencies.
- GroupDocs.Viewer library version 25.2 or later.
### Environment Setup Requirements
- A suitable IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Access to a terminal or command line interface to run Maven commands.
### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of Java and familiarity with Maven will be beneficial as we explore PDF rendering with GroupDocs.Viewer.
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java
### Installation Information
**Maven Setup**
Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial:** Download a trial version to explore basic features.
- **Temporary License:** Request a temporary license for full access to advanced capabilities without limitations.
- **Purchase:** Buy a full license to unlock all functionalities for commercial use.
### Basic Initialization and Setup
Start by importing the necessary GroupDocs.Viewer classes in your Java application. Here’s how you can initialize it:
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
// Import additional required packages
```
Ensure that your project is configured correctly with Maven, which will handle dependency management automatically.
## Implementation Guide
In this section, we’ll walk through the steps to disable text selection in PDF rendering using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java. This feature is crucial when you need to display sensitive information securely on web pages.
### Disabling Text Selection
#### Overview
Rendering text as images prevents users from selecting or copying text within the rendered HTML document. This approach secures content by making it non-interactive.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### 1. Set Up Output Directory and File Paths
```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// Define output directory path for rendered files
Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "DisableTextSelection");
// Create a file path format for individual HTML pages
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");
```
**Explanation:** This code block sets up the destination where your rendered HTML files will be stored. The `Paths` class is used to create and manage file paths efficiently.
##### 2. Configure Viewer Options
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;

try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("TestFiles.ONE_PAGE_TEXT_PDF")) {
    // Configure rendering options to use embedded resources and disable text selection
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    options.getPdfOptions().setRenderTextAsImage(true);

    // Render the PDF document using these options
    viewer.view(options);
}
```
**Explanation:** 
- **`HtmlViewOptions`**: Configures how HTML is rendered, with `forEmbeddedResources()` ensuring all resources are embedded.
- **`setRenderTextAsImage(true)`**: This crucial setting renders text as images to disable selection.
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the source PDF path (`TestFiles.ONE_PAGE_TEXT_PDF`) is correct and accessible.
- Check file permissions for the output directory to avoid write errors.
## Practical Applications
This feature has several real-world applications:
1. **Secure Document Display:** Ideal for displaying confidential documents on web platforms without risking unauthorized copying.
2. **Web Portals:** Enhances security in portals where user data is displayed.
3. **Educational Platforms:** Prevents students from easily copying content, encouraging original note-taking.
Integration possibilities include embedding these secure PDF views within custom CMS systems or standalone HTML applications.
## Performance Considerations
### Optimization Tips
- Render large documents incrementally to manage memory usage efficiently.
- Use embedded resources sparingly if the document contains a lot of images or media to reduce load times.
### Resource Usage Guidelines
Monitor application performance when rendering complex PDFs, as converting text to images can be resource-intensive. Optimize Java memory settings accordingly.
## Conclusion
We’ve explored how to disable text selection in PDF rendering using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java by rendering text as images. This feature is crucial for secure content display on web pages and offers numerous practical applications.
**Next Steps:**
- Explore additional GroupDocs.Viewer features to enhance your document management solutions.
- Experiment with different configurations to suit your specific needs.
