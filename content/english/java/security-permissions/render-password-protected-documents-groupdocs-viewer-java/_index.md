In this guide, we'll cover:
- Setting up GroupDocs.Viewer in your Java environment
- Loading password-protected documents
- Rendering documents to HTML format

By the end of this guide, you will be able to implement a robust document rendering solution. Let's start with the prerequisites!

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine.
- A basic understanding of Java programming and Maven project management.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and running Java code.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java

To start using GroupDocs.Viewer, you need to set up the necessary dependencies in your project. Here's how you can do it:

### Maven Setup

Include the following configuration in your `pom.xml` file to add GroupDocs.Viewer as a dependency:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs.Viewer offers a free trial, temporary licenses for testing, and full purchase options:

- **Free Trial**: Download the library from [GroupDocs Releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/).
- **Temporary License**: Request a temporary license to evaluate all features.
- **Purchase**: For production use, consider purchasing a license through [GroupDocs Purchase](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization

Once the dependencies are set up, you can initialize GroupDocs.Viewer in your Java application. Hereâ€™s a simple setup:

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
// Other necessary imports...

public class DocumentViewer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize and configure GroupDocs.Viewer here
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's implement the feature to render password-protected documents.

### Rendering Password-Protected Documents

#### Overview

This section demonstrates how to load a document protected by a password using GroupDocs.Viewer. We'll configure the application to convert it into an HTML format for easy viewing.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

##### Load Options and Set Password

To access a password-protected document, create `LoadOptions` and specify the password:

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.LoadOptions;

// Define your document path and output directory
String inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX_WITH_PASSWORD";
Path outputDirectory = java.nio.file.Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");

LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.setPassword("12345"); // Replace with the actual document password
```

##### Configure HtmlViewOptions

Set up `HtmlViewOptions` to determine where the rendered HTML pages will be saved:

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;

HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```

##### Create Viewer Instance and Render Document

Use a try-with-resources statement to create a `Viewer` instance, ensuring proper resource management:

```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(inputFilePath, loadOptions)) {
    // Render the document using specified view options
    viewer.view(viewOptions);
}
```

### Explanation

- **LoadOptions**: This class allows you to specify parameters for loading documents. Here, it is used to provide the password.
- **HtmlViewOptions**: Configures how and where the output HTML files are saved.
- **Viewer**: The main class that handles rendering operations.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the document path and password are correct; otherwise, an exception will be thrown.
- Check file permissions for both input and output directories to avoid IO errors.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Viewer can be integrated into various applications:

1. **Enterprise Document Management Systems**: Streamline secure document sharing within organizations.
2. **Web-based Document Viewers**: Enhance user experience by providing quick access to documents online.
3. **Document Approval Workflows**: Automate viewing processes for approval systems.

## Performance Considerations

When rendering documents, consider these tips:

- Optimize resource usage by managing memory allocation in Java applications.
- Use caching mechanisms if the same document is accessed frequently.
- Monitor application performance and adjust configurations as necessary.

## Conclusion

You've learned how to set up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java and render password-protected documents efficiently. This powerful tool can significantly enhance your application's document handling capabilities.
