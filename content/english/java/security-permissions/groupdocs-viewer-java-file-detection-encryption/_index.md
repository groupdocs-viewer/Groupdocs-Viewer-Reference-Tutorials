- **Maven:** For managing dependencies in your project.
- **Knowledge of Java Programming:** Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts.

Ensure these prerequisites are met to follow along smoothly as we explore the setup and implementation steps.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java
To start using GroupDocs.Viewer, integrate it into your Java project via Maven:

**Maven Setup**
```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial:** Download a trial version to explore basic functionalities.
- **Temporary License:** Request a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase:** Acquire a full license for production use.

After setting up the dependency, initialize your project with GroupDocs.Viewer:
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;

public class ViewerSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/YOUR_FILE";
        
        try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath)) {
            System.out.println("GroupDocs.Viewer initialized successfully.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
### Feature 1: Check File Encryption
#### Overview
This feature allows you to determine if a document is encrypted, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Import Required Classes
Begin by importing necessary classes:
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.results.FileInfo;
```

##### Initialize Viewer and Check Encryption
Replace `'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY'` with your document's path:
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/ENCRYPTED";
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath)) {
    FileInfo fileInfo = viewer.getFileInfo();
    boolean isEncrypted = fileInfo.isEncrypted();

    if(isEncrypted) {
        System.out.println("The file is encrypted.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The file is not encrypted.");
    }
}
```
- **Parameters & Method Purpose:** `viewer.getFileInfo()` retrieves metadata, including encryption status.
- **Troubleshooting Tip:** Ensure the document path is correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.

### Feature 2: File Type Detection
#### Overview
Identify the type of a file quickly to tailor processing steps accordingly.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Obtain and Output File Type
Use the same initial setup as above for importing classes:
```java
String filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/ANY_FILE";
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(filePath)) {
    FileInfo fileInfo = viewer.getFileInfo();
    String fileType = fileInfo.getFileType();

    System.out.println("The file type is: " + fileType);
}
```
- **Parameters & Method Purpose:** `fileInfo.getFileType()` returns the document format.
- **Troubleshooting Tip:** Unsupported files may return null or an unexpected result.

## Practical Applications
1. **Secure Document Management:** Automatically classify and secure sensitive documents within your organization's repositories.
2. **Automated Report Generation:** Tailor report outputs based on file types detected by GroupDocs.Viewer.
3. **Legal Compliance Checks:** Verify encryption status to meet data protection regulations like GDPR.

Integrating these features can streamline processes in industries such as finance, healthcare, and legal services where document security is critical.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Use `try-with-resources` for automatic resource management.
- **Java Memory Management:** Regularly monitor memory usage to prevent leaks.
- **Best Practices:** Keep your library version up-to-date and profile applications for potential bottlenecks.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure efficient performance while using GroupDocs.Viewer in your Java projects.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored how to utilize GroupDocs.Viewer for Java to detect file types and check encryption. By implementing these features, you'll enhance your document management capabilities significantly. As next steps, consider exploring more advanced functionalities of the library or integrating it with other systems like databases or cloud storage.
