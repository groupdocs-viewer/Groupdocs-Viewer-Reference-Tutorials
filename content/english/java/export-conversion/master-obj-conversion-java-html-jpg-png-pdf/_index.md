## Implementation Guide

Explore how to render OBJ files into different formats using GroupDocs.Viewer Java API.

### Rendering OBJ to HTML

**Overview:** Convert 3D models into interactive, web-friendly HTML pages with embedded resources.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Set Up the Output Directory**
   
   ```java
   Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
   Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("obj_result.html");
   ```

2. **Create Viewer Instance**
   
   ```java
   try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_OBJ")) {
       // Code for rendering will go here
   }
   ```

3. **Configure HTML View Options**
   
   ```java
   HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
   ```

4. **Render the OBJ Document**
   
   ```java
   viewer.view(options);
   ```

**Explanation:** The `HtmlViewOptions` class ensures resources are embedded directly within HTML, providing a seamless viewing experience.

### Rendering OBJ to JPG

**Overview:** Convert 3D models into high-quality JPEG images for easy sharing and display.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Set Up the Output Directory**
   
   ```java
   Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
   Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("obj_result.jpg");
   ```

2. **Create Viewer Instance**
   
   ```java
   try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_OBJ")) {
       // Code for rendering will go here
   }
   ```

3. **Configure JPG View Options**
   
   ```java
   JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
   ```

4. **Render the OBJ Document**
   
   ```java
   viewer.view(options);
   ```

**Explanation:** The `JpgViewOptions` class handles conversion settings, including output path and image quality.

### Rendering OBJ to PNG

**Overview:** Transform 3D models into PNG format, perfect for maintaining transparency in images.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Set Up the Output Directory**
   
   ```java
   Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
   Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("obj_result.png");
   ```

2. **Create Viewer Instance**
   
   ```java
   try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_OBJ")) {
       // Code for rendering will go here
   }
   ```

3. **Configure PNG View Options**
   
   ```java
   PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
   ```

4. **Render the OBJ Document**
