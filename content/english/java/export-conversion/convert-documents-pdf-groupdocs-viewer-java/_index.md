## Implementation Guide

Now, let's dive into converting your documents to PDF using GroupDocs.Viewer. We'll break this down into manageable steps:

### Convert Document to PDF

**Overview**

In this section, we will convert a document from any supported format (e.g., DOCX) into a PDF file.

**1. Initialize the Viewer with Your Document**

Start by creating an instance of `Viewer` and providing it the path to your document:

```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX")) {
    // Further processing will be done here.
}
```

**2. Set Up PDF View Options**

Next, configure the `PdfViewOptions` using a custom file stream factory. This allows you to control how the output is managed:

```java
MemoryFileStreamFactory streamFactory = new MemoryFileStreamFactory();
PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(streamFactory);
```

**3. Render the Document to PDF Format**

Use the `view()` method on your `Viewer` instance to perform the conversion:

```java
viewer.view(options);
```

**4. Obtain and Use the Resulting PDF Stream**

Finally, extract the resulting PDF as an input stream for further use or storage:

```java
InputStream pdfStream = streamFactory.getStream();
pdfStream.close(); // Always remember to close streams after usage.
```
