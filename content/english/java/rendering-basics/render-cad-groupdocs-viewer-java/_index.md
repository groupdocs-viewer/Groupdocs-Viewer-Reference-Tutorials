      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition Steps:
1. **Free Trial**: Obtain a free trial to explore features.
2. **Temporary License**: Apply for extended access during development.
3. **Purchase**: Acquire a full license for production use.

## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to render specific layouts from CAD drawings using GroupDocs.Viewer in Java:

### Render a Specific Layout

#### Overview
This feature allows you to extract and display designated sections of a CAD file, focusing on particular design elements.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory
Create an output directory for the rendered HTML files:

```java
Path outputDirectory = Utils.getOutputDirectoryPath("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
```
*Explanation*: The `Utils.getOutputDirectoryPath` method ensures your files are saved in the desired location.

#### Step 2: Configure Output Page Format
Set up naming for each rendered page:

```java
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");
```
*Explanation*: The `{0}` placeholder allows dynamic file naming, useful when rendering multiple layouts or pages.

#### Step 3: Set Up HtmlViewOptions
Configure `HtmlViewOptions` to specify how the CAD layout will be rendered:

```java
HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```
*Explanation*: The `forEmbeddedResources` method ensures resources like images and styles are embedded within each HTML file, enhancing portability.

#### Step 4: Specify Layout Name
Indicate the layout you wish to render:

```java
viewOptions.getCadOptions().setLayoutName("Model");
```
*Explanation*: Specifying "Model" directs GroupDocs.Viewer to focus on this particular layout, ignoring others.

#### Step 5: Render the Layout
Use a try-with-resources statement to manage the `Viewer` object:

```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_DWG_WITH_LAYOUTS_AND_LAYERS)) {
    viewer.view(viewOptions);
}
```
*Explanation*: The `view` method processes the CAD file, rendering the specified layout as HTML files in your output directory.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all paths and filenames are correctly configured to avoid errors.
- Verify that the specified layout exists within the CAD file to prevent issues.

## Practical Applications
Rendering specific layouts from CAD drawings has several real-world applications:

1. **Architectural Presentations**: Display individual sections of a building plan for focused discussions.
2. **Manufacturing Prototypes**: Highlight particular components in machinery designs during reviews.
3. **Educational Tools**: Use isolated layers or views to explain complex concepts.
4. **Integration with Document Management Systems**: Automatically extract and display specific layouts within workflows.
5. **Customized Reporting**: Generate reports focusing on key design elements for project updates.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Monitor memory usage during rendering, especially with large CAD files.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Use Javaâ€™s garbage collection and resource management features effectively. Close resources like `Viewer` instances promptly after use.

## Conclusion
You've mastered the basics of rendering specific layouts from CAD drawings using GroupDocs.Viewer for Java. This capability can streamline your workflow by allowing you to focus on particular design elements with precision.
