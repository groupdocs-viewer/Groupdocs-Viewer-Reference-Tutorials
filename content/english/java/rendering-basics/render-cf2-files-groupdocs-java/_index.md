### Basic Initialization and Setup
With your environment ready, initialize GroupDocs.Viewer:
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
// Initialize viewer with file path or stream
Viewer viewer = new Viewer("path/to/your/document.cf2");
```
Now let's delve into rendering CF2 files to various formats.

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into four main features: converting CF2 files to HTML, JPG, PNG, and PDF. Each section includes step-by-step guidance with code snippets.

### Rendering CF2 to HTML
**Overview**: Convert a CF2 file into an interactive HTML document with embedded resources.

#### Step 1: Import Required Packages
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
```

#### Step 2: Define Paths and Initialize Viewer
Set directory paths for your CF2 document and output HTML file.
```java
Path inputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("CF2_result.html");
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(inputDirectory.resolve("Sample.cf2"))) {
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.view(options);
}
```
**Explanation**: This snippet initializes the `Viewer` with a CF2 file and specifies HTML view options to embed resources within the output.

### Rendering CF2 to JPG
**Overview**: Convert your CF2 document into a JPEG image for easy sharing and viewing.

#### Step 1: Import Required Packages
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.JpgViewOptions;
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure Options
Set up the output path for the JPG file and render the document.
```java
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("CF2_result.jpg");
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(inputDirectory.resolve("Sample.cf2"))) {
    JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.view(options);
}
```
**Explanation**: The `JpgViewOptions` class specifies the output file path and renders the CF2 document as a JPEG image.

### Rendering CF2 to PNG
**Overview**: Convert CF2 files into high-quality PNG images.

#### Step 1: Import Required Packages
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.PngViewOptions;
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure Options
Define the output path for the PNG file and render it.
```java
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("CF2_result.png");
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(inputDirectory.resolve("Sample.cf2"))) {
    PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.view(options);
}
```
**Explanation**: By using `PngViewOptions`, the CF2 file is rendered as a PNG image, ensuring high resolution and quality.

### Rendering CF2 to PDF
**Overview**: Generate a PDF document from your CF2 file for easy distribution and printing.

#### Step 1: Import Required Packages
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.PdfViewOptions;
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Viewer and Configure Options
Set the output path for the PDF file and render it.
```java
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("CF2_result.pdf");
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(inputDirectory.resolve("Sample.cf2"))) {
    PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(pageFilePathFormat);
    viewer.view(options);
}
```
**Explanation**: The `PdfViewOptions` class configures the rendering of CF2 files into PDF format, ensuring compatibility across devices.

## Practical Applications

Rendering CF2 files with GroupDocs.Viewer for Java has numerous applications:
