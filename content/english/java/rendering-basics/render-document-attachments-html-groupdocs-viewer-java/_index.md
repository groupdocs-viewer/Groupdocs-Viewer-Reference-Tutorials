## Implementation Guide

This guide covers rendering document attachments into HTML and managing these using CacheableFactory.

### Render Document Attachments into HTML

Convert an attachment from a document, such as embedded files within emails, into HTML format for seamless display within web applications.

#### Overview
Learn to extract attachments from documents like emails containing Word docs and render them as interactive HTML pages with GroupDocs.Viewer.

##### Step 1: Set Up Output Directory
Define the output directory where rendered HTML files will be saved:

```java
Path YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = Utils.getOutputDirectoryPath("RenderDocumentAttachments");
Path pageFilePathFormat = YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.resolve("page_{0}.html");
```

##### Step 2: Create an Attachment Object
Use the `CacheableFactory` to create an `Attachment` object, aiding in efficient caching:

```java
Attachment attachment = CacheableFactory.getInstance().newAttachment("attachment-word.doc", pageFilePathFormat.toString());
```

##### Step 3: Extract and Render the Attachment to HTML
Utilize the `Viewer` class to render the specified document's attachment into HTML format with embedded resources:

```java
try (ByteArrayOutputStream attachmentStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
     Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS")) {
    
    // Save the specified attachment to a byte stream.
    viewer.saveAttachment(attachment, attachmentStream);

    try (InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(attachmentStream.toByteArray());
         Viewer attachmentViewer = new Viewer(inputStream)) {
        
        HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
        attachmentViewer.view(options); // Render the attachment into HTML.
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```

##### Explanation of Key Steps:
- **CacheableFactory**: Manages caching to prevent redundant processing, enhancing performance.
- **HtmlViewOptions**: Configures rendering with embedded resources for a complete viewing experience.

### Initialize and Use CacheableFactory for Attachment Management

Efficient attachment management is crucial when dealing with large documents or multiple files. This feature demonstrates using `CacheableFactory` to optimize handling document attachments.

#### Overview
Learn the benefits of initializing a cache manager for improved performance in your GroupDocs.Viewer applications.

##### Step 1: Create an Attachment Object Using CacheableFactory

```java
Attachment attachment = CacheableFactory.getInstance().newAttachment("attachment-word.doc", "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/page_{0}.html");
```

#### Explanation:
- **CacheableFactory**: Provides efficient cache management, reducing resource usage and improving speed.

## Practical Applications

Rendering document attachments to HTML can be beneficial in various scenarios:

1. **Email Clients:** Display email attachments directly within the client without requiring separate file downloads.
2. **Document Management Systems:** Allow users to view all embedded files from a single document interface seamlessly.
3. **Web Portals:** Enhance user experience by displaying comprehensive documents with interactive elements.

## Performance Considerations

When using GroupDocs.Viewer, consider these performance optimization tips:
- Utilize caching mechanisms via `CacheableFactory` to minimize redundant processing.
- Monitor memory usage and optimize your application for handling large documents.
- Follow Java best practices for memory management, like using streams efficiently and closing resources promptly.

## Conclusion
