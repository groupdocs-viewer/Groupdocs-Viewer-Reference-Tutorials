#### Basic Initialization and Setup
After adding the dependency, initialize GroupDocs.Viewer by creating an instance of `Viewer` with your file path. This is the starting point for rendering files into different formats.

## Implementation Guide
Now that our setup is ready, let's explore how to render EMZ/EMF files into various formats using specific features of GroupDocs.Viewer.

### Rendering EMZ/EMF to HTML

#### Overview
Convert EMZ or EMF files into HTML format for easy viewing in any web browser. This feature is perfect for displaying vector graphics on websites without needing plugins.

##### Step 1: Set Up the Viewer Instance
Create a `Viewer` object with your input file:
```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_EMZ)) {
    // Configuration code follows...
}
```

##### Step 2: Configure HTML View Options
Use `HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources()` for rendering:
```java
HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(outputDirectory.resolve("emz_result.html"));
```

##### Step 3: Render the Document
Invoke the `view` method to perform conversion:
```java
viewer.view(options);
```

### Rendering EMZ/EMF to JPG

#### Overview
Converting to JPEG is ideal for platforms requiring raster formats. This feature simplifies transforming vector graphics into high-quality images.

##### Step 1: Initialize Viewer with Input Document
Start by creating a `Viewer` instance:
```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_EMZ)) {
    // JPEG-specific configuration follows...
}
```

##### Step 2: Set Up JpgViewOptions
Prepare the options for JPEG conversion:
```java
JpgViewOptions options = new JpgViewOptions(outputDirectory.resolve("emz_result.jpg"));
```

##### Step 3: Execute Rendering
Call `view` to convert and save as a JPEG file:
```java
viewer.view(options);
```

### Rendering EMZ/EMF to PNG

#### Overview
PNG is preferred for images requiring transparency. This feature allows rendering vector graphics into this versatile format.

##### Step 1: Create Viewer Instance
Initialize with your source file:
```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_EMZ)) {
    // PNG-specific setup follows...
}
```

##### Step 2: Configure PngViewOptions
Set up the options for PNG conversion:
```java
PngViewOptions options = new PngViewOptions(outputDirectory.resolve("emz_result.png"));
```

##### Step 3: Render to PNG
Execute the rendering process:
```java
viewer.view(options);
```

### Rendering EMZ/EMF to PDF

#### Overview
PDF is a widely used format for documents, ideal for sharing vector graphics in an accessible way.

##### Step 1: Initialize Viewer
Create a `Viewer` instance with your file:
```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_EMZ)) {
    // PDF-specific configuration follows...
}
```

##### Step 2: Set Up PdfViewOptions
Prepare the options for PDF conversion:
```java
PdfViewOptions options = new PdfViewOptions(outputDirectory.resolve("emz_result.pdf"));
```

##### Step 3: Convert to PDF
Perform the rendering:
```java
viewer.view(options);
```

## Practical Applications
