## Implementation Guide

### Loading and Rendering a Document
This feature focuses on loading a document from your local disk and rendering it as HTML. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Define Paths Using Placeholders
Set up paths for input documents and output directories with placeholders.
```java
import java.nio.file.Path;

Path YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = Path.of("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"); // Replace with actual document path
Path outputDirectory = YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY.resolveSibling("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY").toAbsolutePath(); // Output directory for HTML files
```
**Explanation:** These paths specify where source documents are located and where rendered HTML files should be saved.

#### Step 2: Set Up File Format and View Options
Configure how each document page will be saved as a separate HTML file.
```java
Path pageFilePathFormat = outputDirectory.resolve("page_{0}.html");
HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources(pageFilePathFormat);
```
**Explanation:** The `forEmbeddedResources` method ensures resources like images are embedded within the HTML, making it self-contained.

#### Step 3: Load and Render the Document Using GroupDocs Viewer
Use the Viewer class to load and render your document.
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;

try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY.resolve("SampleDocx.docx"))) { // Replace with actual document name
    viewer.view(viewOptions); // Render the document using specified options
}
```
**Explanation:** This snippet creates a `Viewer` instance, loads your document, and renders it into HTML using previously defined view options.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all paths are correctly set and accessible.
- Verify Maven configuration to avoid dependency issues.
- Check for exceptions during rendering and refer to GroupDocs documentation for solutions.
