- Extracting page numbers from documents
- Retrieving text lines from document pages
- Practical use cases and integration tips

By the end, you’ll be able to build robust solutions that efficiently process and analyze document content.

Let’s start with the prerequisites required to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing GroupDocs.Viewer features in Java, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Versions
- **GroupDocs.Viewer for Java** (version 25.2 or later)
- Maven setup on your development environment for managing dependencies

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- Familiarity with basic Java programming concepts.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Maven and dependency management in Java projects.
- Experience working with file I/O operations in Java is beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java

To start, include the necessary dependencies in your project. If you’re using Maven, add the following configuration to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition Steps

- **Free Trial:** Download a free trial from the [GroupDocs downloads page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/).
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extended testing through the [temporary license page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase:** For full access and support, consider purchasing a license via the [GroupDocs purchase portal](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization

To initialize GroupDocs.Viewer in your Java application:
1. Import necessary classes.
2. Create a `Viewer` object with your document path.
3. Use `ViewInfoOptions.forPngView(true)` to specify PNG rendering.

## Implementation Guide

We’ll break down the implementation into two main features: extracting page metadata and text lines from documents.

### Extracting Page Metadata

This feature allows you to retrieve metadata such as page numbers, which can be invaluable for indexing or navigation purposes.

#### Overview
- **Purpose:** To iterate through each page in a document and extract its number.
  
#### Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize Viewer:"
   ```java
   try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX")) {
       ViewInfoOptions viewInfoOptions = ViewInfoOptions.forPngView(true);
       ViewInfo viewInfo = viewer.getViewInfo(viewInfoOptions);
   ```
2. **Iterate Over Pages:**
   ```java
   for (Page page : viewInfo.getPages()) {
       int pageNumber = page.getNumber();
       System.out.println("Page: " + pageNumber); // Outputs the page number
   }
   ```
3. **Explain Parameters and Methods:**
   - `ViewInfoOptions.forPngView(true)`: Configures to get page info as PNG for rendering.
   - `getPage()`: Retrieves a list of pages containing metadata.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the document path is correct.
- Confirm that the GroupDocs.Viewer dependency version matches your setup.

### Extracting Text Lines from Pages

Extract text lines to analyze content structure and gather specific information per page.

#### Overview
- **Purpose:** To extract and print each line of text on a document's pages.
  
#### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Viewer:"
   ```java
   try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX")) {
       ViewInfoOptions viewInfoOptions = ViewInfoOptions.forPngView(true);
       ViewInfo viewInfo = viewer.getViewInfo(viewInfoOptions);
   ```
2. **Retrieve and Print Lines:**
   ```java
   for (Page page : viewInfo.getPages()) {
       System.out.println("Page: " + page.getNumber());
       System.out.println("Text lines:");
       
       for (Line line : page.getLines()) {
           String lineText = line.getValue();
           System.out.print(lineText + "\t");
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Key Configurations and Methods:**
   - `getLines()`: Retrieves text lines from a given page.
   - The loop iterates through each line, printing its content.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Verify that the document format is supported by GroupDocs.Viewer.
- Check for any exceptions related to file access or permissions.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world applications where these features can be beneficial:
1. **Document Indexing:** Automate indexing processes by retrieving page numbers and text lines, facilitating quick searches.
2. **Content Analysis Tools:** Develop tools that analyze content structure and formatting.
3. **Integration with Search Engines:** Enhance document search capabilities within your applications.
4. **Data Extraction for Reports:** Extract specific data points from documents to generate reports or summaries.
5. **Legal Document Processing:** Use text extraction to automate the review of legal documents.

## Performance Considerations

When working with GroupDocs.Viewer, consider these tips for optimal performance:
- **Resource Management:** Ensure efficient use of memory by disposing of `Viewer` objects properly.
- **Batch Processing:** Process documents in batches if dealing with large volumes.
- **Configuration Tuning:** Adjust rendering options based on your specific needs to reduce overhead.
