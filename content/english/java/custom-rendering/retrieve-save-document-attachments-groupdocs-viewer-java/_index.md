## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java
To get started with using the GroupDocs.Viewer API in your project, you need to install it via Maven. Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**License Acquisition Steps:**
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore the features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for an extended evaluation period.
- **Purchase**: For production use, you'll need to purchase a license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once GroupDocs.Viewer is added as a dependency in your project, initialize it in your Java application. Here’s how:

```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import java.nio.file.Path;

public class InitializeViewer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("path/to/your/document")) {
            // Your code to interact with the document goes here.
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This basic setup initializes the GroupDocs.Viewer and prepares it for retrieving attachments.

## Implementation Guide

### Retrieve Attachments from a Document
Let’s break down how you can retrieve attachments using GroupDocs.Viewer. This feature allows you to extract metadata about each attachment present in your document.

#### Overview
Retrieving attachments involves accessing the `getAttachments` method, which returns a list of Attachment objects containing details like file name and size.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Create a Viewer Instance**
   Initialize the `Viewer` class with the path to your document:

   ```java
   import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
   import com.groupdocs.viewer.examples.TestFiles;
   import com.groupdocs.viewer.results.Attachment;

   public class FeatureRetrieveAttachments {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS)) {
               // Proceed to retrieve attachments
           } catch (Exception e) {
               throw new RuntimeException(e);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Retrieve Attachments**
   Use the `getAttachments` method:

   ```java
   List<Attachment> attachments = viewer.getAttachments();
   for (Attachment attachment : attachments) {
       System.out.println(attachment.getFileName());
   }
   ```

3. **Understanding Parameters and Methods**
   - `Viewer`: Takes a file path or stream to the document.
   - `getAttachments()`: Retrieves a list of attached files, providing details like names.

### Save Document Attachments to a Directory
Now that you've learned how to retrieve attachments, let's save them to your desired directory using GroupDocs.Viewer API.

#### Overview
This feature involves saving each retrieved attachment file to a specified output directory. 

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Define the Output Directory**
   Set up an `outputDirectory` path where files will be saved:

   ```java
   import java.nio.file.Path;
   import java.nio.file.Paths;

   Path outputDirectory = Paths.get("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
   ```

2. **Save Attachments**
   Use a loop to save each attachment using the `saveAttachment` method:

   ```java
   try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(TestFiles.SAMPLE_MSG_WITH_ATTACHMENTS)) {
       List<Attachment> attachments = viewer.getAttachments();
       
       for (Attachment attachment : attachments) {
           final Path file = outputDirectory.resolve(attachment.getFileName());
           try (FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(file.toFile())) {
               viewer.saveAttachment(attachment, outputStream);
           }
       }
   } catch (Exception e) {
       throw new RuntimeException(e);
   }
   ```

3. **Explain Parameters and Methods**
   - `saveAttachment`: Takes an Attachment object and a file output stream to save the attachment.
   - `FileOutputStream`: Manages writing data to files.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all Maven dependencies are correctly added.
- **File Path Errors**: Double-check paths for both documents and output directories.
- **Access Permissions**: Verify that your application has necessary permissions to read/write files.

## Practical Applications
Using GroupDocs.Viewer in Java can be invaluable across various scenarios:

1. **Email Clients**: Automatically extract attachments from email archives for processing or archiving purposes.
2. **Document Management Systems**: Enhance document management by retrieving and organizing attached files.
3. **Legal Departments**: Extract evidence-related attachments from legal documents securely.

Integration possibilities with other systems like CRM or ERP can further streamline business processes, making attachment handling seamless across departments.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Viewer:
- **Optimize File Handling**: Use efficient file I/O operations and consider buffering for large files.
- **Memory Management**: Be mindful of memory usage, especially with large documents. Ensure proper resource cleanup to prevent leaks.

Adhering to best practices in Java memory management will significantly enhance the efficiency of your document handling tasks.
