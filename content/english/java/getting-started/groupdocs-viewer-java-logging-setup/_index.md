**Key Learning Points:**
- Configure logging in GroupDocs.Viewer for Java.
- Implement both console and file-based logging systems.
- Render documents to HTML with embedded resources using GroupDocs.Viewer.

Before we begin setting up our environment, let's review the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
1. **Required Libraries:**
   - GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library (version 25.2 or later).

2. **Environment Setup Requirements:**
   - A Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
   - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
   - Basic understanding of Java programming.
   - Familiarity with Maven for dependency management.

With these prerequisites in place, you're ready to set up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java!

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Viewer for Java
To use GroupDocs.Viewer, add it as a dependency in your project using Maven. Hereâ€™s how:

### Maven Setup
Add the following configuration in your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-viewer</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial:** Download a free trial from [GroupDocs Releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/).
- **Temporary License:** Acquire a temporary license to remove evaluation limitations at [GroupDocs Temporary License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase:** For full access, consider purchasing a license at [GroupDocs Purchase](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization
Initialize GroupDocs.Viewer with the following pattern:
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;

// Initialize with sample PDF file and settings
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("path/to/your/document.pdf")) {
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources("output_directory/page_{0}.html");
    viewer.view(options);
}
```

This setup forms the foundation for more complex logging configurations.

## Implementation Guide
Explore how to implement console and file-based logging with GroupDocs.Viewer.

### Feature 1: Logging to Console
#### Overview
Logging to the console provides immediate feedback in your terminal, useful during development or debugging phases.

#### Steps:
##### Step 1: Import Required Classes
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.ViewerSettings;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.logging.ConsoleLogger;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;
```
##### Step 2: Set Up Logging Configuration
Use `ConsoleLogger` to direct logs to the console.
```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("path/to/your/document.pdf", 
    new ViewerSettings(new ConsoleLogger()))) {
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources("output_directory/page_{0}.html");
    viewer.view(options);
}
```
##### Explanation
- **ConsoleLogger:** This class directs logs to the console, providing a real-time view of operations.
- **HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources:** Generates HTML with embedded resources for each page.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
Ensure your document path is correct and accessible. Verify that logging statements are appropriately configured in your console settings.

### Feature 2: Logging to File
#### Overview
Logging to a file helps maintain a persistent record of operations, useful for auditing or post-mortem analysis.

#### Steps:
##### Step 1: Import Required Classes
```java
import com.groupdocs.viewer.Viewer;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.ViewerSettings;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.logging.FileLogger;
import com.groupdocs.viewer.options.HtmlViewOptions;
```
##### Step 2: Set Up File-Based Logging Configuration
Use `FileLogger` to write logs to a specified file.
```java
try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("path/to/your/document.pdf", 
    new ViewerSettings(new FileLogger("output.log")))) {
    HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources("output_directory/page_{0}.html");
    viewer.view(options);
}
```
##### Explanation
- **FileLogger:** This class directs logs to a file named `output.log`.
- **ViewerSettings with FileLogger:** Configures GroupDocs.Viewer to log activities in the specified log file.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
Ensure the directory for the output file is writable. Check file permissions if logging fails.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Viewer can enhance document management and rendering capabilities:
1. **Web Portals:** Render documents on-the-fly for web users without direct downloads.
2. **Enterprise Systems:** Integrate with CRM tools to display contracts or agreements.
3. **Internal Dashboards:** Provide accessible views of reports and presentations within intranets.

## Performance Considerations
When using GroupDocs.Viewer in Java, consider:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Monitor memory consumption when rendering large documents.
- **Java Memory Management Best Practices:** Utilize try-with-resources for automatic resource management.
- **Performance Tuning:** Adjust logging verbosity to balance detail and performance impact.

## Conclusion
You've learned how to configure GroupDocs.Viewer Java to log document rendering activities either to the console or a file. This capability is invaluable for debugging, monitoring, and auditing your applications. Explore further configurations and integrate GroupDocs.Viewer with other systems to enhance its utility within your projects.
